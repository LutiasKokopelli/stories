<p>Miraculously perhaps, the trip had gone off without a hitch. The entity had kept their hat as low as possible and their eyes stuck to its white brim, making sure that their gaze would not meet anyone else’s.</p><p>Claire had at first planned to fill these twenty minutes with some idle chat, whether genuine or faked, in order to break the ice and the awkward silence; hopefully opening the door to, step by step, more interesting subjects, and perhaps even addressing the topic of this mysterious black pouch that her companion would keep so tightly glued to their chest. However, her copy had turned out to be so tense and fully focused on their task, that she had quickly given up. Understanding and sharing their concern, she decided to respect their choice and not tempt fate; only wondering why it was so hard for them to stick to a single appearance, and to only change it through a conscious, desired effort.</p><p>Surely, all these transformations had to cost them some energy in one way or another, and therefore this transitory period between two different disguises was not a state of rest; the reason why it was so difficult for them to remain in control must therefore have to do with their mental state, which was currently so unstable—and quite understandably so, given what had just happened to them. The scientist hoped that this was the only reason, and that nothing else would prevent them from finally acting only on their own terms once they had recovered from all these emotions. Hopefully, having a good time with her and Hershel, and gradually getting used to this strange situation, would help them regain some confidence.</p><p>From then on, Claire only ever spoke to whisper the bare minimum of information: which directions to take, which turns, how much time they had left before arriving at their destination. And so, for more than half of the duration of the trip overall, the only words that were uttered were <i>“This is our stop.”</i></p>
<p class=bar><span>September 28, 1953 — 03:28 PM</span></p>
<p>Hershel Layton, newly appointed professor of archaeology at Gressenheller University of London, and only person to ever get such a position at the young and tender age of twenty-seven.</p><p>This title would be quite heavy to bear; but his long years of honest and dedicated work reminded him that it was, above all, well and truly deserved. Just one more week, and he would go back to college; except this time, he would be standing on the other side of the stage, in the lower depths of the amphitheatre.</p><v></v>
<p>Was he uneasy at the idea of teaching students who, for some, might turn out to be only a few years younger than him? Perhaps, but this was hardly his current concern.</p><p>No, the fierce and ruthless fight he was leading at this very moment was much more crucial, much more mature, far beyond such childish nonsense. His adversary would eventually yield to his intransigent will, this was inevitable; it was only a question of patience, of dexterity, of precision… This battle had to end in an absolute victory, especially since his notions of trigonometry, physics and common sense leaned in his favour. This was a matter of honour, and it was a matter of the esteem that all his friends had for him, Claire first and foremost: he could not fail; he <i>must not</i> fail. It was an absolutely ridiculous idea to lose such an absurd, yet essential war against such a laughable and mindless adversary as a—</p><v></v><p>The top hat fell over his eyes once again. Another defeat.</p><v></v>
<p>He could not deny Claire’s good taste, and far be it from him to pretend that this hat was not as elegant and refined as she had judged it to be; but he would have appreciated his new gift so much more, if only he could keep it stable on his head.</p><p>Shortly after Claire had left, just after she had offered it to congratulate him on his new position, he had decided to resume preparing his future lessons, and spend some good time analysing a fossil or two out of the few he had borrowed from the university collection. How naïve! As soon as he was seated at his desk, this fierce hat had decided to slip off and block his view in no time. No matter: imperturbable, he had simply straightened up, readjusted this little impertinent accessory, then returned to his work. But again, in just the span of ten minutes, his reading had caused him to lean a little too much on the fascinating subject of the archaebacterial species that were decimated by the Great Precambrian Oxygenation, and this new hat had taken the opportunity to follow his lead, again seeking his attention with what now could only be outright insolence.</p><p>There is no need to say more: this little game was repeated a good twenty times in the span of the three long hours which had followed the departure of his girlfriend, each time making the task of remaining calm always a little bit more strenuous; and eventually, all idea of studying had left his mind. The young professor-to-be had had the misfortune of underestimating the time it would take to get used to wearing it, and now he was paying the price, now that he was facing his mirror, unable to move from it until <i>at last</i> this hat would comply and remain perfectly stable on his head. Every puzzle had an answer, and it was out of the question for this one to be an exception; but it had no right to be so difficult to solve, moreover for such a stupid reason as what was obviously either a miscalculation, or an unreasonable spark of folly from the hatter who had designed it, or a combination of both.</p><p>His memory did not fail to remind him of the dinner in a gourmet restaurant they had organised for the occasion, and during which he would find not only Claire, but also their dear friends from university Clark and Brenda Triton, and his mentor, Doctor Andrew Schrader. He had better succeeded in taming this new accessory by then, lest he become the laughingstock of the evening. If one were to look closely at this top hat, its height was such that even a deviation of a single degree from verticality would be visible: and thus, surely his friends would not fail to notice it, and to point it out to him.</p><v></v>
<p>Hershel Layton was pulled from his thoughts and mirror when he heard a knock on his front door, and once again a brown hat took a sly pleasure in blocking his view, forcing him to grab its brim and adjust it for perhaps the hundredth time.</p><v></v><p>Many hypotheses as to who the visitor could possibly be had occurred to him, as he rushed to the door; however, finding not one, but <i>two</i> Claires on his doorstep, was definitely not part of the list.</p><p>Only one of the two was wearing the same outfit as the one who had left a little more than three hours earlier, and this one, upon seeing his dumbfounded expression, and all the more upon seeing his hat tilt by more than ten degrees without him realising it, burst into a crystalline laugh. This first clue, followed by this laugh that he would have recognised among a thousand, proved that it was the real Claire. As for the other, the one who stood so tense and seemed to have no other desire but to hide her entire body inside her hat, in spite of the laws of physics… Who was she?</p><p>The extrovert one put her hands on her hips and sent him a teasing smile and look; no more doubt, it was her.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“Hershel, have I ever told you that I have a sister?”</d></p><v></v><p>Taken aback and still bewildered, his head showed a slight jolt—the top hat fell over his eyes as a result, and he readjusted it immediately. He was surprised to realise that he had not even taken the time to make such a deduction, which in retrospect should have been by far the most logical, and quite an obvious one at that.</p><v></v><p><d>“No… I am quite sure that you never mentioned it.”</d></p><v></v><p>He studied one woman after the other: the resemblance was truly staggering, suggesting very strongly the possibility that they could be monozygotic twins. And yet… Until this very moment, he thought that he and Claire had shared everything; she had met his parents, Roland and Lucille Layton, on one or two occasions, and on one fine day, he had in return spent a lovely afternoon with the Foleys. Why hide the existence of another member of her family from him, especially if it was to then introduce her in such a sudden and unexpected manner?</p><p>The twins exchanged a look. The shy one in the blue jacket immediately went back to lowering her hat over her face again, and he saw her tighten her grip around a strange little black pouch. After a short second of immobility, however, he saw a very sharp but discreet nod of agreement from her. Claire had noticed it too, because she crossed her arms, and her smile changed to an emotion that he found himself unable to interpret.</p><v></v><p><d>“Correct!” she exclaimed proudly. “That’s because I don’t.”</d></p><v></v><p>Alright, she had lost him. Where did he last put his hint coins again?</p><v></v><p><d>“But then, who…”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“That’s the thing,” whispered shyly the woman who, in the end, did not have ‘Foley’ as her surname. “We don’t know either.”</d></p><v></v><p>Hershel was certain that never in his entire life had he felt more lost than at this precise moment. Blaming the lack of context and this absurdly farcical situation, he began to wonder if, perhaps, he had just fallen asleep on his desk and started daydreaming; his mentor had indeed told him that it was better to have a less comfortable seat in order to stay awake at work, and that a chair with armrests, even small and thin, was really only a deceptively well disguised pillow. Perhaps this top hat was also part of the dream, because surely, who in their right mind could have had the idea of fashioning such an exaggeratedly tall and impractical hat?</p><p>Claire could almost see cogs turning in her friend’s head, and imagined them now stuck in a thought that was clearly destined to never come to fruition. This vision of a gear disengaged and unable to turn properly seemed very amusing to her, and she laughed again.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“Don’t worry, we can explain what really happened,” she assured. However, she immediately resumed her silence and, rather than proceeding with the aforementioned explanations, she leaned slightly to the side in a teasing way, exaggeratedly mimicking that she was trying to look behind his back. Her smile doubled in size, and she clarified: “…If you let us in, that is.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“I— my apologies. Of course,” he replied absently, immediately clearing the way with a big step to the side, and gesturing the two visitors to come in—all the while readjusting a hat which, of course, once again manifested itself with no other purpose than to annoy him in a way which was bound to be deliberate.</d></p><v></v><p>The mysterious stranger entered first, with a great haste that she made no effort of concealing; and once inside, away from prying eyes, sandwiched between a grey-green desk dripping with books and a simple wooden table, a great sigh of relief immediately escaped her. Claire followed with much more calmness, and he closed the door behind her before turning, once again, towards this astonishing doppelgänger.</p><p>…Was it a trick of the light? It appeared to him that her hair had changed colour, losing its ginger reflections in favour of a common, dull light brown.</p><p>His sweetheart had noticed as well, and once again with a big mischievous smile, she crossed her arms and stage-whispered, actually making sure that he would hear her perfectly:</p><v></v><p><d>“<i>Pssst</i>. Your disguise is falling apart again.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“W-<i>what</i>!?”</d></p><v></v>
<p>Exactly at the same time as this small yelp of surprise, the man saw the one addressed jump in terror, and before she even had the time to meet the ground again, she had grown taller by a full foot, exchanged her blue jacket for a dark brown, longer one, and a ridiculously tall top hat grew out of her head out of nowhere, replacing the little white hat that she had been wearing until then. Had he been in a state to fully analyse the situation, perhaps he would have been able to notice from the sound that resounded when their feet once again came into contact with the floor, that this person was much lighter than they appeared.</p><p>The woman who no longer was one, once back on Earth, froze completely and resolutely refused to turn around. The archaeologist, struck by fear, took a large step backwards and let out a short but very expressive cry. Not waiting to recover from the shock, he immediately turned to his girlfriend and demanded that the situation be fully explained to him. Imperturbable, she finally decided to comply:</p><v></v>
<p><d>“I thought long and hard during the trip about the best way to break it down to you slowly, but I eventually came to the conclusion that whatever we did, this moment would be inevitable. So, I decided that we might as well get it over with right from the start,” she explained with a little remorse in her voice and a smile which was now slightly apologetic, but whose regret was only half sincere. In fact, she was struggling to hide her amusement and the traces of a shameless, devilish grin. And so, she approached her friend and playfully nudged his side with her elbow, adding not without irony: “Besides, you’re a fully fledged member of the screaming club, now. Congratulations.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“C-Claire, that’s not funny!”</d></p><v></v><p>The stranger clasped a hand to their mouth, realising too little too late that the voice that had spoken these words had been a little bit too revealing; and indeed, although their back was still turned, the second step back and the young professor’s silent gasp did not escape their ears. The impostor bit their lip and lowered a replicated top hat over their eyes; a top hat which Hershel recognised perfectly, given the fact that it was a carbon copy of the one that had become his worst enemy during the first part of the afternoon.</p><p>Now finished with her little prank, and feeling sorry that it had been taken so seriously by her two friends, Claire walked to the anomaly who defied physics, and placed a comforting hand on their back. A silent gaze was exchanged, and she soon found herself face to face with a perfect reflection of herself: indeed, the entity had visibly forgotten to apply the alterations to her appearance that they had previously used. Hershel thus looked at one, then the other, back and forth, becoming progressively more disturbed: an icy shiver ran down his spine as he realised that he was unable to detect the slightest difference in their physique, apart from the single black pouch that only one held firmly against her chest.</p><p>While his paranoia could not help but imagine all kinds of evil plots that could have taken advantage of such power, he was all the more grateful for the attitude of this imitation, which seemed to clearly reveal that their intentions were very far from them. Not only was their shy and introverted attitude the best way to distinguish the original from the copy, but it also reinforced his belief that this was exactly what said copy wanted.</p><p>The entity looked half-heartedly at their hands, saw the sleeves of an elegant little white blouse, and sighed. Their eyes fixed on the floor, they walked slowly to a corner of the living room, near a closed door; then, facing the wall and the few photographs that hung on it, they began to gradually alter their shape, in order to return to the false identity with which they had entered. The little black pouch was once again clutched in their arms, as if its presence could bring them some comfort.</p><p>Hershel initially wanted to look away, while their appearance changed; but the spectacle turned out to be so strange and intriguing that he could not silence this form of morbid curiosity that woke up in him, as he desperately sought to analyse and find a rational explanation behind such a phenomenon.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“As you can see Hershel,” Claire whispered to him once she was back by his side, “this person can change appearance more or less at will—although, more often than not, it is <i>against</i> their will. We don’t know anything about them: where them came from, what happened to them and <i>how</i> it happened… They can’t remember either, nor do they know who they used to be. Judging by their behaviour, they would seem to be a young child… but this is only conjecture. So far, they have only been able to mimic other people.”</d></p><v></v><p>The mysterious stranger had completed their new disguise, and although they had come back to face them with an appearance that seemed stable, they were deliberately keeping their distance and continued to stare sheepishly at the ground. Hershel raised a thoughtful hand to his chin out of habit; but this entire situation left him speechless. He replayed the scene mentally, from the arrival of the doppelgängers to this present moment, now with the new information he finally had at his disposal. A number of things found an explanation… but this only brought to light twice as many questions as he had started with.</p><v></v><p>Without realising it, he had been staring intently for several long seconds at what had to be the most incomprehensible mystery he had ever encountered to date. Admittedly, since he had come to settle in London for his studies ten years ago, the only ‘mysteries’ he had had to solve were simple mundane and forgettable little cases, which he would encounter as he would pass by a little too close to Scotland Yard, and as a certain constable named Clamp Grosky would catch him on the way in order to discreetly ask him for help. Said agent was very serious and entirely devoted to his work, and his Herculean strength enabled him to apprehend any criminal with ease; but he was also aware of his own naïvety and limitations when dealing with thugs whose cunning was slightly above average, and so he preferred calling on someone who would be able to see through such tricks. Thus, this was not Hershel Layton’s <i>coup d’essai</i> when it came to solving cases whose solution was not completely straightforward… but these previous cases were miles away from what he had in front of him at this very moment.</p><p>He reminded himself that just before these ten years, he had already explored the ancient ruins of Akbadain and fenced his way through their defence mechanisms, even though he was only in high school; an adventure far more unusual than those he had lived before and since, and an adventure that was by far the most dangerous of his entire life, full of mortal risks—he bit his lip as he remembered this tragic event. What he was getting at was that since this disastrous adventure, he had persuaded himself that nothing stranger and more mysterious could have happened to him, than what he had found down there. But obviously, seeing the person he had in front of him… He had been way off the mark.</p><v></v>
<p>Feeling watched, the mystery in question trembled slightly, raised a shy and pale face, identical to that of his girlfriend, and stared back at him with anguished and shining eyes. This gesture had the archaeologist jolt back to reality, and he was just about to apologise for his staring having brought them discomfort; but the very moment he opened his mouth, the stranger’s anxiety seemed to double in intensity, and with it, many ginger strands of hair leapt to the ceiling, shortening and losing their curls. Their owner cried once more in surprise, grabbed their white hat in order to bury their head in it all the way down to their nose, and apologised profusely.</p><v></v><p>The real Claire looked at them both sadly, then invited them to sit down—walking to her double again, and gently showing them an empty chair facing the simple wooden table nearby.</p><v></v><p><d>“This day is far from over, but it has been quite eventful already for all of us,” she said calmly… and with an audible exhaustion. She walked away from them, opened the door leading to the rest of her boyfriend’s apartment, and only stopped once she stood in the frame. She shared with them her latest decision: “I will go make some tea, as I’m sure we all need it.”</d></p><v></v><p>Then, without waiting for their answer, she disappeared into the kitchen, leaving the young professor and the stranger alone. A long silence followed…until the adult tried to break the ice.</p><v></v><p><d>“And so… You really can take on any shape?”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“I guess?” they replied, lowering their gaze and shrugging. “But most of the time, I don’t really get to decide when it happens.”</d></p><v></v><p>Leaning slightly against the back of his wooden chair (and adjusting his top hat for the umpteenth time), the man again brought a thoughtful hand to his chin and let out a simple, undecided and pensive <i>“Hmm.”</i> Their ability to change their appearance was already a great mystery in itself; but more so was the ability to take on a set appearance, especially to imitate those who faced them, with this much speed and ease. He tried to think about the cognitive abilities that such a feat would require.</p><p>Such an aptitude for spatial visualisation, and such visual acuity… Few experienced adults could boast of having both, himself included. Had he been in their place, he sincerely doubted that it would have been possible for him to achieve such a level of precision in such a short time, at the very first glance. Did he think that the task would have been completely impossible for him? Probably not; but it was the extreme speed and efficiency of the act that concerned him so.</p><p>There were two main possibilities: either the intellectual capabilities of this child were off the charts, so they could become a near perfect copy of any person that came to their mind, whether present or not before them, and this in only a few seconds at most… or the mechanism linked to these transformations was even more complex than it seemed, and the active and conscious effort of the child themselves ultimately participated very little in the phenomenon. Needless to say, the young professor had a certain inclination for the second hypothesis, all the more so if this child would transform regularly against their will.</p><p>Again, he was pulled from his thoughts when said child continued the conversation with a desperate whisper:</p><v></v>
<p><d>“If only I could remember who I was…”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“I assume you’ve already discussed this with Claire,” he replied gravely. “Did you find any clues to start from?”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“Almost nothing. And even if we did… It’s only memories, now. It doesn’t matter what I used to look like, there’s nothing left of it!”</d></p><v></v><p>Hershel pursed his lips tensely when he saw that his interlocutor was on the verge of tears. However… Something quickly washed off his sympathetic expression,  and replaced it with an inquisitive one.</p><p>So, they said that there was ‘nothing left’ of their actual identity…? Once again, a quiet sceptical breath escaped him.</p><v></v><p><d>“Actually,” the young professor said cautiously, “about that… There is a hypothesis I would like to confirm, and which might interest you. We would need to perform a little experiment in order to test it, though.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“An experiment?” the child repeated, intrigued. “What do you need?”</d></p><v></v><p>Instead of answering directly, he stood up from his chair, walked to his desk and, without a word, started searching for something. Claire’s double, still seated at the table, saw him retrieve four small white sheets of paper, the ink foam base of a datestamper, and a handkerchief; then, he came back to the table and sat back down, facing them once more.</p><p>Their eyes widened in surprise when they saw the man press the tip of his fingers lightly against the foam, and then place them gently on one of the four sheets, one by one, using his handkerchief mid-process in order to clean them—though he could only limit by a few the number of unwanted stains, at best. This lasted for almost a full minute, until he was left with ten plump marks, lined up like canned sardines, and two hands that were almost dry, all things considered, but still blackened in several places. As he stood up again, he gave two sheets of paper to the stranger, politely invited them to do the same, then walked to the kitchen and explained his idea to Claire while he washed his hands properly with soap and water.</p><p>When he returned to the table, one of the two sheets had been filled; the impostor, still busy wiping their fingers dripping with black ink, looked up at him with a pair of curious eyes.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“What am I supposed to do with this one?” they asked, pointing to the other sheet that had been entrusted to them, and was still white as snow.</d></p><v></v><p><d>“Well, I’d be curious to see what would happen if you did it again, but with a different identity…” he confessed, before entering a heavy silence that lasted for quite a few seconds. He grasped the brim of his top hat with a touch of embarrassment and nervousness, and looked away before specifying: “…Mine, for that matter.”</d></p><v></v><p>And with a small, embarrassed smile, as he was still speaking, the young professor shrugged awkwardly and sent them an evasive hand wave as encouragement. The entity noticed that despite the soap and water, some ink still remained on his fingers; the spiral patterns they bore only stood out all the more, becoming visible even from several feet away. Perhaps because he had seen it too, the man promptly returned to the kitchen, and proceeded to wash his hands again.</p><p>A more astute observer could have noticed, however, that the residual ink had only remained on one of his hands, and that the other had actually been cleaned properly the first time. It was probably what had allowed him to adjust his top hat without taking the risk of staining it.</p><v></v><p>Claire waited until she was done preparing the tea, before following suit and filling out her own sheet. Bringing a teapot and three empty cups on a tray, she put it all in the middle of the table, distributed the cups, then sat down and busied herself with dipping her fingers one by one, while her boyfriend poured the warm and soothing drink into each of the cups. Despite himself, the man cast a quick glance at his double, which to his relief was not reciprocated. He knew that he had only himself to blame for this time, but he tried all the same not to pay too much attention to this reflection of himself which was a little too alive for his taste, and to keep his eyes anywhere else.</p><p>Finally, after another long minute, the task was completed. Three heads bent apprehensively over the result of the experiment—and when two top hats collided, one of them apologised and immediately changed shape, while the other sighed and readjusted his wearily.</p><v></v><p>Out of the four sheets of paper, only one pair was found. Exactly one: not two, not zero. A single pair of sheets, whose fingerprints looked strictly identical; and both belonged to the same person. The size of the prints was certainly different, one set belonging to the hands of a man, the other to the hands of a woman; and yet, strange as it may seem, their patterns were disconcertingly similar.</p><p>Hershel heaved a quiet sigh of relief, reassured that his intuition had been right; then, he raised a smile and a now perfectly confident look at the owner of the prints in question.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“When you take on our appearance, the likeness seems perfect to us,” he explained confidently. “However, even if the differences are invisible to the naked eye, it doesn’t mean that they don’t exist. In the end, you are merely imitating us: I was right to think that you wouldn’t be able to achieve such a level of precision just by looking at us. After all, it’s not like you’ve had a chance to see our fingerprints until now.” He took a short moment of silence, before adding, “Well… almost. I hesitated to take this risk, but when I asked you to take on my appearance, I showed you one of my hands. But as we can see, you apparently didn’t have the time or ability of taking it into account.”</d></p><v></v><p>Claire was delighted, but did not seem surprised; it was likely that when the archaeologist had come to see her in the kitchen in order to tell her about his experience, he had also told her the details of his hypothesis.</p><p>The child realised that the hand gesture that they had seen from him had actually been perfectly calculated; they were all the more impressed, given that they had been completely oblivious to it. They carried on looking at the various sheets with great interest… but it seemed that they still had to be told the full and true conclusion that had to be drawn from this observation. And so the man went on, giving them a reassuring smile:</p><v></v><p><d>“This not only proves that you were unable to reproduce our fingerprints… but also that the ones present on these two sheets of paper are most likely yours. It is undeniable that these fingerprints belong to you—to you, and no one else.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“So we <i>do</i> have something tangible to prove your identity!” Claire added with a wide smile and sparkling eyes, clasping her hands happily.</d></p><v></v><p>A few heavy seconds were necessary for their words to take on their full meaning; but soon enough, the stranger’s face lit up, their eyes widening from the weight of the realisation.</p><p>Two trembling hands approached slowly, almost with fear, one of the two sheets which contained the last remaining proof of their existence. Bringing it closer to their distraught face, these ten round spots danced before their eyes. Despite their uncontrollable tremors, the copy of the young physicist managed to fold the sheet with great application, then hugged it to their heart with a long sigh.</p><p>In a soft but tense, barely audible voice, the amnesiac stranger whispered a few words of endlessly grateful sincerity:</p><v></v><p><d>“Thank you… Thank you so much.”</d></p><v></v><p>In response, the couple simply smiled tenderly. The scientist, cheerfully picking up her teacup, advised them to drink their tea while it was still hot; and they immediately followed her lead, this great news giving them a newfound interest in the sweet aroma that emanated from their cup.</p><p>The shape-shifter now seemed to be immersed in their thoughts, not even realising the small black marks that their fingers, still full of ink, left on their cup of tea. Taking advantage of this moment of distraction, Claire took a sip, then discreetly leaned over to her boyfriend, who was sitting right next to her.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“This won’t get us very far,” she whispered to him. “Scotland Yard only keeps the fingerprints of criminals, and even if they didn’t…”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“Of course,” he replied with a quiet sigh. “But… We can at least give them some hope. Looking at them right now, they needed to hear it.”</d></p><v></v><p>She nodded, agreeing with him on this point. The conjecture he had just proven was a big step towards solving the mystery… but it was also far from being a tangible clue on its own, as these fingerprints in themselves did not have much use in a serious investigation.</p>

<!-- Bonus Note: I had a really hard time finding the title of this chapter, but now that I have it, I particularly appreciate how it relates to the storyline. On the other hand, I wish you good luck if you intend to find the reference. If you can figure out its full meaning right now, hats off, because wow that must mean I'm really not good at keeping mysteries, if you've already solved it before the end of the second chapter. -->
