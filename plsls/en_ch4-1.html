<p class=em>Some will argue that a frank, sincere and good-hearted laugh can come out of any circumstance, for any reason imaginable. That any subject of discussion, any event, any words, can be turned into a joke which, if only with the assistance of time, should be considered as being <i>objectively</i> funny. As if it were possible to imagine that humour could somehow, in any shape or form, have any amount of rational and scientific impartiality to it.</p><v></v><p>In this very moment, Hershel Layton and Claire Foley felt the furthest away possible from laughing.</p><v></v><p>If everything they had been told within the past ten minutes was the terrible truth, however improbable it may be, then a young child had travelled back in time from their future, and changed History on a scale that exceeded by far everything they could fathom; a scale that crushed all hope of possibly restoring its original course; a scale which could even be precisely the source of their particularly unusual condition, as they kept triggering metamorphosis upon metamorphosis.</p><p>Thinking about this kind of ordinarily fictional scenario, there will always be some who will mention the butterfly effect. Well, in this time especially, if this last point were given all the more consideration… It was all the more relevant, in far more than just the usual meaning of the idiom.</p><v></v><p>And there they stood before them, overflowing with imprudence, or recklessness, or both; a wide, carefree and innocent smile on their face; now determined to make their situation even worse than it already was, without the slightest hesitation, as if their terrible and possibly incurable symptoms weren’t already a convincing enough deterrent for them to learn from their mistake.</p><v></v><p>Claire sighed deeply, shaking her head in exasperation.</p><v></v><p><d>“…I’m calling Dimitri,” she eventually announced, standing up from her chair with both a determined frown, and a still very white and shaky voice.</d></p><v></v><p>The archaeologist nodded solemnly, and pointed absently in the direction of a secluded corner of the entrance. He knew full well that his girlfriend had come by often enough to know where to find his phone; but in his defence, his mind was currently busy with quite a few other things, and the fact that she did not need his guidance had thus momentarily slipped his mind.</p><p>Thus, the young woman had walked away in that direction without uttering another word, each of her steps echoing loudly against the floor. Soon her voice was heard again, but this time it was muffled by the distance and the door that she had closed behind her path.</p><v></v>
<p>Hershel took advantage of this moment of almost complete silence to think back over what had been revealed to them, dissecting every sentence he had heard, trying somehow to separate one by one each piece of information that had been dropped at a bewildering speed.</p><p>He tried as best he could to forget everything about the fact that he would have supposedly lost Claire on this day; that there had been a possibility that this lunch they had together, during which she had given him this top hat, during which she had left in a hurry because of her lateness, during which they hardly had found the time to bid each other <i>goodbye</i>… That there had been a possibility that this would have been the last time he would have ever seen her alive. But… How could he possibly brush aside this horrible thought?</p><p>He wished he could remain impartial, agree with Claire, and fully scold this time traveller for the mess that had been caused; but… Did this child really save her life? This explosion and the implausible, but oh so daunting consequences that they had mentioned, had they all really been feasible under other circumstances? Did this person in front of him really have such knowledge that they could prevent similar events, which could save dozens, or perhaps even hundreds of other innocent lives?</p><v></v>
<p>All this was so dazzling to even conceive… And it was all the more difficult for him not to feel tempted—compelled, even, by his morals, to listen to them. He had never lost Claire, she was still there, very much alive, just in the next room; and yet, in this moment, it seemed to him as if he had just caught a glimpse of a lifetime of mourning; that he had just experienced, within the span of a single second, years of loneliness, of despair, of injustice… All this, all the while he had not even found yet the time to ask this question that had been gnawing at him for so long!</p><v></v><p>He was… It was far too risky to embark on such an adventure without sufficient planning, all the more so if there was the slightest possibility that deviating from the course of time as it was originally supposed to go, further than they already had, could generate an even more terrible catastrophe than the one they had hoped to avert. However, since Claire was currently pondering this exact question with her colleague… He bit his lip, but straightened up and cast a look that pierced through the stranger in front of him.</p><p>He knew how to be reasonable. All he was about to do was ask for information; nothing more. There was no harm in simply making some enquiries… was there?</p><v></v><p><d>“Clay,” he began with a heavy hesitation. “Do you confirm that by ‘doing it again’… Do you confirm that what you meant was that there are <i>other</i> disasters that are about to happen, and that you would also wish to alter?”</d></p><v></v>
<p>Without a word, the copy of the small teenager in a blue sweater and cap pursed their lips while puffing their cheeks, still sporting that same childish pout which was trying, in vain, to look serious. They gave a slow, decisive nod. Hershel sighed gravely.</p><v></v><p><d>“Assuming that, <i>hypothetically</i>, we were to agree to prevent these accidents and change the future for the better. Can you tell me what would be at stake?”</d></p><v></v><p>They took a long moment of thoughtful silence, raising their head to the ceiling and letting out small pondering breaths. At times, it was possible to see them count several different and varied things on their fingers, although it would have been impossible to tell what they were about. And finally, after a few minutes, their answer arrived, just as heavy in meaning, and with an elocution just as excessive as the previous ones:</p><v></v><p><d>“So, if I’m not forgetting anything, there would be the destruction of two—no, wait, perhaps three or four towns? I guess only the central tower collapsed in Saint-Mystere, and it’s debatable whether or not Folsense counts, since none of its inhabitants other than the Duke were real… But that still leaves Misthallery, which was under the attack of an excavation machine for several months and then ended up flooded, and Monte d’Or which was almost swept away in a landslide and could’ve gotten buried under tons of sand.</d></p><p><d>“Ah, and, I’m not counting London because I’ve already talked about it, but in case you wanted the details, it ended up with, uh… Let’s say there’s a big hole in it. I don’t know how many people died or were injured, but it’s probably in the thousands, if not tens of thousands.</d></p><p><d>“There’s also that criminal organization that’s already causing a lot of trouble, so I guess that if we can take them down early, that would save a lot of people too. What else… Oh yeah, that’s right! There’s also that one time when we came close to the end of humanity because of an Azran golem army.”</d></p><v></v><p>There was a very short pause, as they looked away and pouted; as if this last point had been the only one that bothered them, while all the previous ones had been perfectly mundane events. So, they added after a mere second of hesitation:</p><v></v><p><d>“…About the Azran golems, don’t worry, I’d too stopped trying to understand by then. Actually, whenever it’s about the Azran civilization in general, I’m not even trying to understand anymore. But aside from that… Yeah, I think that’s about it.”</d></p><v></v><p>The archaeologist wondered what had possessed him to dare think that it would have been a good idea to ask such a question, considering the fifteen minutes he had just been through prior to it.</p><p>Was he sceptical? Of course he was, it was out of the question to believe in such enormities without being given tangible proof beforehand.</p><p>Surprised, on the other hand… Unfortunately for his growing migraine, it appeared to him that by this point, nothing could surprise him anymore.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“…Alright,” he muttered with a weary sigh, pinching the top of his nose between two exasperated fingers. “And, again, <i>assuming</i> that we agree to assist… Where would you start? What would be your plan?”</d></p><v></v><p>With a bit of luck, exposing the core of the issue would lead to two possible outcomes: either Clay would prove that all of their allegations were baseless, or he would finally gain access to some context behind such outlandish events, which seemed to come out of nowhere.</p><p>Before the time traveller could answer, however, their conversation was interrupted: indeed, the front door had opened, and Claire’s head poked out of it. Receiver still in hand, she asked with both politeness, and with a strange mixture between distress and authority, if she could borrow a pen and paper, judging that a large number of equations needed to be reviewed. Hershel obviously did not mind, and naturally invited her to help herself. Nodding briefly, she exchanged a few more words with the person on the other end of the line, then hung up and walked to her boyfriend’s desk with great haste.</p><v></v><p><d>“Bill isn’t responding, but Dimitri will be running some tests shortly,” she explained as she fished a fountain pen out of a pencil holder. “He should call back in about fifteen minutes, after he’s had the time to get there and launch the scanners.” And as she continued to painstakingly pluck off a few vaguely blank sheets one by one, making sure that she was not about to accidentally vandalise millennia-old rune transcriptions with her futuristic mathematical symbols, she added: “I could’ve joined him, but it would take too long to wait for the bus. It feels more efficient to stay here and recheck our calculations while we wait for the results.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“But… What could go wrong, really?” Clay asked shyly. “I’m sure it’s not worth worrying <i>that</i> much…”</d></p><v></v><p>The physicist stopped dead in her non-archaeological digs, turned around, and glared at them. Claire was certainly a charming lady who took great care of her manners and expressed genuine respect for anyone; however, if only in this moment and towards this little being who had generated such an overwhelming amount of emotions in only a handful of hours… her patience still had its limits.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“Where should I begin,” she responded immediately with both annoyance and nervousness. “Among the first hypotheses that came to mind: perhaps your actions will have caused a local change in one or more fields of interaction, generating a metastable bubble which, if it were to spread, would modify all the laws of physics and would most likely lead to a new model which would be incompatible with life as we know it;</d></p><p><d>“Or maybe the conjecture that we can only have a single worldline will turn out to be partially incorrect, and your actions will have spawned the creation of an alternate timeline, in which case we should make sure that we are in a fully independent universe, and not in a quantum superposition state with the timeline that you originally knew, since in this second case, this quantum superposition is, again, extremely unstable and could collapse at any moment;</d></p><p><d>“<i>Or</i>, since we have no idea what happened to you, but that it seems that <i>something</i> in your metabolism, or in your chemistry, or perhaps even in the very nature of the <i>subatomic particles</i> that compose you has changed—you could become the epicentre of a disaster of similar magnitude, the ins and outs of which we know absolutely nothing about. Here are three possible scenarios in which we are dealing with a time bomb that will affect our entire universe, and this is just the beginning. Shall I continue?”</d></p><v></v><p>The only thing that dared break the silence to answer her question was the poor little fly that had inadvertently found itself trapped within the immaculate and delicately intertwined, but deceptively heavy folds of the window curtains. Claire stared at the time traveller for another short second and a half, then punctuated her speech with a sarcastic <i>Thank you</i> accompanied by a strict nod of her head; then, clutching a pile of messy papers to her chest, she stormed off, slamming the door behind her.</p><v></v><p>The two remaining people exchanged a dumbfounded look, not knowing what to say for at least a good half minute. Finally, Clay dared to ask in embarrassment:</p><v></v><p><d>“…Professor, did you understand any of it?”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“I think I understood that we could be in danger, and that if any of the hypotheses she was talking about is true, then the ‘bomb’ is already ticking as we speak,” he translated awkwardly, making it clear that he also had been largely overwhelmed by the slightly too technical vocabulary that she had used. A few more seconds of silence resounded, and then he turned to the child, looked at them with small confused eyes, and added: “Also… Please, you don’t have to call me ‘Professor.’ I didn’t expect to hear that word off campus, to be honest.”</d></p><v></v><p>The only response he got was a pair of eyes so puzzled that they were ready to pack their bags, break out of their orbit, and fly off to the campus in question, if only so they could gain the legitimacy to keep addressing him by this title. Hershel remembered that they had told him word for word that <i>everyone called him that</i> back in their time, and… He really did not know what to make of it.</p><p>Judging with annoyance that this fight would end with an outcome as victorious as the one that followed the war which had opposed him to his new top hat, he sighed deeply, and decided to move on; now focusing, once again, on what he had right in front of him at this very moment.</p><v></v>
<p>Clay was far from being just one great mystery: following the same tendency as their ability to take on a theoretically infinite number of identities, the mystery that surrounded them actually hid an amalgam of dozens of others, which intertwined, trickled, flowed like grains of sand dancing to the rhythm of time itself, trapped within their pyramid of glass. But out of all these mysteries, one stood out more than the others: for it was of a fundamentally different nature.</p><p>Most of the mysteries surrounding Clay were mysteries in the sense that they were currently unable to identify their source, and find a rational explanation behind their existence. The mystery he kept in mind, on the other hand, was a mystery in the sense that it was quite simply based on an impossible contradiction, which rested on two axioms that were, at least at first glance, completely incompatible.</p><p>First: Clay had amnesia, and had no memory of who they were or where they came from.</p><p>Second: Clay knew them perfectly, and had incredibly accurate memories of future events that would have involved them, if only they had not intervened to alter the flow of time.</p><v></v><p>No matter how he turned these two elements around in his head, he saw no way to resolve such a situation other than by the far-fetched hypothesis he had given Claire, the one stipulating that Clay had <i>coincidentally</i> forgotten only the memories which regarded precisely their identity but that their memory was otherwise intact, by the means of some kind of metaphysical and mystical phenomenon, because they had accidentally erased their own existence from History… Or by the assumption that one of these two axioms was bound to be wrong—and only one of the two could be so without contradicting the evidence they had accumulated so far.</p><p>In other words: if the far-fetched hypothesis was incorrect—something he very well expected, given that he was not a physicist and that the meagre credibility he lent this incredible scenario was only due to the fact that Claire had not outright refuted it just yet—then the only other explanation he could come up with… was that Clay did not actually have amnesia. In which case… This really was the best acting performance he had ever witnessed.</p><p>If acting there was, it was so perfect and convincing that despite the fact that it was by far the simplest and most logical explanation behind this mystery, he nonetheless remained largely convinced of their sincerity. Not enough to completely rule out this option, no… But enough to make the conscious and thoughtful choice to give them the benefit of the doubt, until he could find an indisputable flaw in their words and prove that they were lying outright.</p><v></v><p>But enough digressing. He was not going to learn much by sustaining the silence and limiting himself to his own thoughts.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“If you don’t mind, I would like to return to what we were talking about earlier,” he stated suddenly. “You gave a rather… exhaustive list of events that were as terrible as they were implausible. Now, since your wish is to ensure that they won’t take place… How would you go about it?”</d></p><v></v><p>Eager to resume the conversation they had started before Claire came to interrupt them, he had therefore recalled his last question: because if this time traveller intended to ask for his help to change History more than it had already been, he first wanted to hear what specific initiatives they had in mind. On the one hand, because he preferred to wait for the results of the tests that Claire had mentioned before actually getting involved; on the other hand, because he wanted to put his interlocutor to the test and assess their limits—as much in the extent of their knowledge, as in their capacity for reflection and planning. Perhaps he could even make use of their answers in his subsidiary investigation, and take this as an opportunity to test the legitimacy of their alleged amnesia.</p><p>From what he had seen so far, he was facing a living encyclopaedia, at least if what had been said was the pure truth, and not the incredible rantings from a child borne with a little too much imagination. Nevertheless, were they an encyclopaedia capable of thinking for themselves, or one who would mindlessly repeat facts they had been taught?</p><v></v><p>Clay frowned in intense concentration… then seemed to reach a conclusion, which they immediately shared:</p><v></v>
<p><d>“Most of the events I talked about will only happen in quite a few years,” they reassured at first. “But… I was thinking of someone in particular, and I hope it’s not too late to help him.”</d></p><v></v>
<p>Naturally, the archaeologist invited them to say more, starting by giving him a name; first with a simple silent nod…then with an encouraging, but nevertheless rather impatient <i>“Well?”</i>, when he once again faced a child who had remained silent for too little too long for his liking.</p><v></v><p><d>“It’s… I’ll admit that I have no idea how you’re going to react. It scares me a little.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“Is it someone I know?” he asked, judging by the child’s attitude that the answer was most likely going to be positive.</d></p><v></v><p>Yet, instead of the simple nod he had expected, the man received a very hesitant <i>“yes and no”</i> which could not possibly have been more cryptic. Sighing, he decided to change his approach and take a longer, but also more subtle path.</p><v></v><p><d>“Before even telling me who it is… You spoke of large-scale disasters, of cities destroyed by various cataclysms. And yet, you would like to start by helping only one person? It’s quite the jump in scale of importance, or at least so it seems.”</d></p><v></v><p>These last words from the archaeologist could seem insensitive and almost hypocritical, as he would dismiss the life of a single person even though at first, it was precisely the fact that a single woman had been saved that had drove him to ask all these questions; simply because this woman had been the one he loved more than anything in the world, while this other person was still a stranger to him. However, his gaze betrayed the emotions he kept deep inside him; although he only used cold and hard reason to move the discussion forward, his empathy was not lacking… It was only kept silent. Or almost: because the reasoning he immediately put forward might not have been able to be formulated if it had not existed.</p><v></v><p><d>“It seems that you have a very specific reason for wanting to help him more than anyone else,” he concluded with a voice whose assurance showed that he found this deduction quite obvious. “May I know what it is?”</d></p><v></v><p>The child’s eyes darted away to such extent that the man found himself facing more sclera than pupil. There was a long inhale; very deep, and very hesitant.</p><v></v><p>There actually was far more than only one underlying reason… and in all honesty, they wanted to reveal none of them, due to their unpleasant nature. It was not easy to find the best balance between transparency and sensitivity… And it was even more difficult to find the least painful way of convincing him, without having to give the whole truth. After all, the whole truth… They probably should not be the one to reveal it; and perhaps, even, revealing it would have been a source of unnecessary suffering, if their future actions could outright erase them from this new reality anyway.</p><p>Finally breaking this interminable and unbearable silence, the child buried a sheepish head in their shoulders, closed their eyes as if expecting to be beaten for what they were about to say; and a shy murmur was uttered with such speed, and at such a low volume, that the adult was almost unable to hear it.</p><v></v>
<p><d>“Because he’s your brother.”</d></p><v></v><p>And the silence returned. After the half second it had taken him to mentally repeat this sentence in slow motion, and then to fully understand each of its words, Hershel raised a surprised, confused, and sceptical eyebrow.</p><v></v><p><d>“If you really know me, you should know that I’m an only child,” he simply said, straightening up and crossing his arms.</d></p><v></v><p>There was, once again, always that same pursed-lipped pout, almost smiling but with a smile far more nervous than truly caused by a desire to laugh. And, again, this pout was followed by a long, loud inhale, as their eyebrows lowered with a crestfallen and sorry expression. They awkwardly raised their arms and made a series of evasive and disorderly gestures, forming misshapen circles in the air with hands that pretended to grasp and weigh objects that did not exist; all this, while resounded some sort of embarrassed and apprehensive, long vocal and almost singsong hesitation, their mouth slightly open with a grimace which clearly showed their inner conflict. This attitude, just as childish as it was revealing on its own… The young professor easily interpreted it as a very talkative <i>“You are wrong, and you are <b>really</b> not going to like what comes next.”</i></p><p>Now sharing their fear, the adult lost a very large part of the assurance he had maintained until then, as if this child had really been able to germinate doubt within him. His silence became more serious and interminable still, mixing both impatience… and apprehension of what Clay was going to tell him, once their inner debate over.</p><v></v><p>The aforementioned internal debate did indeed reach a conclusion, after a while: their face tense and firm, the time traveller had finally made up their mind regarding the best way to clear the air.</p><v></v><p><d>“Alright, I’m going to give you a name, and… I think I won’t say anything else, I’ll just let you think about it. Just to see if it rings any bells.”</d></p><v></v><p><d>“I’m listening,” he replied immediately, with as much eagerness as growing concern.</d></p><v></v><p>Their lips quivered. They took a deep breath, much longer and deeper than any of the previous ones; they closed their eyes again, dropping their head in a sorry and fearful manner; then, the promised words were finally revealed:</p><v></v><p><d>“Theodore Bronev.”</d></p><v></v><p>There was a great silence. At first, nothing happened: Hershel Layton merely stared at them in confusion. However, soon enough… his eyes narrowed and fell into a blur, as a real thought process had begun. One could begin to see flashes of curiosity in his little ebony pupils, as if there were, indeed, a few faint traces of a distant memory, here and there, slowly growing and clumping together like crystals of limestone at the very bottom of a teapot that had been forgotten and neglected for almost twenty-five years. And then, finally…</p><v></v><p class=em>A teacup fell to the ground.</p>
