<wip id=why_1963><p class=vs><b>“Unwound Future takes place in winter 1963/1964”</b> has been chosen as the original starting point of reference for this timeline in terms of year count. The source behind this is an artwork/concept art from 2008, which is present on the <a href=https://www.layton.jp/jikan/>official Japanese website</a> of Unwound Future, and on the Japanese & US box arts of the game.</p><p><span class=infoa><u>This is a <b>semi-arbitrary choice</b> whose canonicity can be debated.</u><span class=infob style=width:512px><b style='font-size:1.2rem;border-bottom:3px solid rgb(var(--midd))'>American (left) and Japanese (right) Box Arts:</b><br><br>Luke and Layton are obstructing the view, but it can still be seen that the clock is the same as the one from the official website.<br><br><img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/layton/images/c/cf/Unwound_Future_Boxart.jpg style='width:48%;border:2px solid rgb(var(--midd))'><img src=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/layton/images/0/0b/Layton3.jpg style='width:48%;border:2px solid rgb(var(--midd))'><br><br><b style='font-size:1.2rem;border-bottom:3px solid rgb(var(--midd))'>The in-game version of the clock has no digits:</b><br><br>Within the game itself, the digits have been removed and replaced with random buttons; this is why the canonicity of this date is up for debate.<br><br><img src=ast/uf/m1006a.png></span></span> It has been chosen here for the sake of convenience, but it should be relatively easy for you to change the year if it does not suit your personal views.</p><div id=pn1_b><a href="javascript:SwapDiv('pn1','pn1_b')"><br><b>» Click here to read more about the analysis of the digits.</b></a></div><div id=pn1 style=display:none><div style='overflow:hidden;height:100px;width:300px;margin:17px auto;border-radius:17px'><img src=https://www.layton.jp/jikan/img/top/img_top.jpg style='margin:-645px 0 0 -850px;min-width:2000px'></div><p class=vb>Here is a close-up of the date shown on the artwork. Unwound Future is about time travel, between “the present” and “ten years later”: it can be assumed that these moving digits are meant to reflect this. The rightmost two digits are changing, to give the year(s) 『１９ＸＹ』. From this, we can deduce that:</p><ul><li><b>Ｘ alternates between 6 and 7.</b> The number 7 is easily recogniseable. Furthermore, we can deduce that the digit above it is 6 and not 8: the series’ aesthetic was confirmed to have been <u class=infoa>inspired by the 1960s<span class=infob><h2>Page #029 of <i>The World of Professor Layton</i> <a href=https://i.imgur.com/1NZ4VJt.jpeg>(Photo)</a>:</h2><blockquote><i>I’d say Professor Layton’s London is based on London from around the 1960s, though we tried not to restrict ourselves too much in terms of the era because the series does have a lot of fantasy elements to it, like giant robots.</i></blockquote></span></u>, and the DS version of Curious Village contains an unused, now obsolete <u class=infoa>artwork reading “Year 1960”<span class=infob><img src=ast/misc/cv_unused_1960.png></span></u> (more on that later). Therefore, it is safe to conclude that <b>“the present” is set in the 1960s</b>, and that the (fake) “ten years later” is set in the 1970s.</li><p style=margin:17px>This also helps clear up the problem behind the last digit:</p><li><b>Ｙ alternates between 3 and 4.</b> Once again, 4 is unmistakable; as for whether the number above it is a 3 or a 5, I made the assumption that all four digits are displayed in the same order: in the previous case, 6 was displayed above 7, therefore 3 should be the number displayed above 4, and not 5.</li><li><b>In conclusion:</b> This image <i>seems</i> to be leaning towards the message <i>“Your destination is the year 1973/1974 (not really but spoilers).”</i> And thus, <b>Unwound Future took place in 1963/1964</b>.</li><p style=margin:17px>In practicality, it should not be a 100% certainty; but since 3 and 4 were the numbers chosen by the artist, I decided to go along with it.</p><li>Furthermore, I figured that Unwound Future was more likely to take place in <b>winter (between roughly November 1963 and February 1964)</b>, since it snows at the end.</li></ul><p class=vb><i>Small digression: December 31, 1963 would be quite poetic for the events of Unwound Future, as another explanation for the change between 3 and 4; but this is just a personal opinion and we will not consider it in this timeline.</i></p><hr class=vb><p class=vb>An alternative to this point of reference could be <u class=infoa>the unused artwork mentioned earlier<span class=infob><img src=ast/misc/cv_unused_1960.png></span></u> datamined from Curious Village, which would imply that Curious Village would have taken place in the year 1960. This unused artwork has been ignored here in favour of the 1963/1964 artwork because the latter is more recent and still publicly available on both the official website and various Unwound Future merchandise; while the Curious Village artwork is older and was never used or even shown publicly, as the only way we can even know of its existence is through datamining.</p><a href="javascript:SwapDiv('pn1','pn1_b')"><b>» Collapse</b></a></div></wip>
<wip id=why_jap><p class=vs>If there is a <b>contradiction between the translations</b> (for example, Puzzle #030 of Diabolical Box gives a different date for Dropstone’s foundation depending on the language of the game), the Japanese version will be chosen by default.</p><p>If <b>two Japanese sources contradict each other</b> (for example, the Unwound Future “1963/1964” promotional artwork vs the Curious Village “1960<span style=font-size:1rem>年</span>” datamined image), the more recent source will usually be taken as a canon fact retconning the older one <i>unless</i> this newer source ① is significantly less reliable than the older one (e.g. an interview would be taken as less reliable than in-game proof), or ② contradicts more previously established facts than the older one would.</p></wip>
<wip id=why_chars_ages><p class=vb>I will only add a character’s age in the timeline if it has <b>officially been stated</b>. For example, though we know that Layton was 27 when he became professor, and though we know that the events of Unwound Future took place “ten years later,” we have no tangible evidence that Layton is <i>actually</i> 37 during the latter. Depending on the calculations, since it is not necessarily <i>exactly ten years later</i>, it is entirely possible that Layton would actually still be 36, or already have turned 38. Therefore, I will only state their age if it has been canonically given, and let you do the math for the missing entries.</p><p class=vs>Additionally, if a character’s age is officially revealed in relation to a given story, then it is assumed until proven impossible by subsequent evidence that <b>their age remains constant during the entire duration of that story</b>. This is especially relevant in the case of Azran Legacy, which takes place over the span of multiple months.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://www.layton.jp/choubunmei/character/chara03.html>Emmy’s age is stated to be 26 in Azran Legacy</a>: it is thus assumed that her age is 26 from the moment she embarks on the Bostonius, up to the moment when she leaves Layton and the credits roll.</p></wip>
<wip id=why_python><p class=vs>I wrote a <b>python script <a href=timeline.py>(available here)</a></b> which is able to take a list of requirements (e.g. <i>“Event A took place x amount of time before Event B”</i>) and a list of the characters’ known ages, and which will help find <b><i>one</i></b> possible combination of dates that suits all of these requirements. If you see in this timeline an extremely precise date that seems to come out of nowhere (see the Deduced Date column), this python script is the reason why this date was picked. As more and more information regarding the characters’ ages and time between events will be found, the list of possible combinations will decrease in size.</p><p class=vb>Do note that this script may contain errors and/or oversights, so please do review it carefully if you intend to use it, and let me know if you find any mistake!</p><p>In short, <b>the Deduced Date column in the timeline is <i>one possible date that happens to work so far</i>, but which is absolutely not <i>the</i> only possibility</b>. It is also extremely likely to change as more information is added to this timeline, which may or may not make these preliminary guesses impossible afterwards.</p></wip>
<wip id=why_real_world><p class=vs>This timeline will <b>completely disregard any parallels with real History</b>, and only mention events and facts that have been stated in-universe. Even if we assume that the in-universe date is 1960, they have steampunk mechas, ancient civilisations with magic (you are <i>not</i> going to convince me that resurrecting the dead is not magic), dubious chemicals that definitely would not work that way according to <i>our</i> laws of physics. So even if they mention St Paul’s Cathedral, Scotland Yard or the Tower Bridge, it would be (in my opinion) a bit presumptuous to assume that they were built under the same conditions and at the same time as the versions we know in our world.</p><p>The same goes for real world events such as wars, major discoveries, or walking on the Moon; I will assume that they did not occur in the Layton universe until proven otherwise (in the case of Historical events); and then, if it does turn out that they took place in-universe, assume that they did not <i>necessarily</i> take place at the exact same time as in real History. The Layton series mentions going into space and landing on the Moon, which occurred in 1969 in our world: I will thus assume that in the Layton universe, <i>especially since technology is more advanced than in our world’s 1960s</i>, the Moon landing took place earlier; solving the apparent anachronism.</p></wip>
<wip id=why_us_names><p>When referring to specific games, novels and other media, I will be using the American name rather than the European one (for example, “Diabolical Box” instead of “Pandora’s Box”). This is a purely arbitrary choice for simplicity purposes.</p></wip>

リッチマン ----- ナゾトキゲームの参加者。明確な描写はないが、ナゾナンバー001でバーグランドの罠にはまり、脱落したと思われる。リッチマンを除く上記の参加者達は、マルコと同様に、エンディングでは無事が確認されている。ちなみに、直前に逃げようとしたり、ナゾナンバー001で脱落した観客達は、落とし穴に落とされたが、物語の途中で、ナゾナンバー002で脱落した観客達と共に、救命艇を使って、船から脱出していたためリッチマンも無事ではないのかと思われる。

    Last Specter - Ruins were discovered 6 months ago, Clark has been mayor for about a year, Barde has been dead for a year, bought the flute right before, events take three days. Descole hired Jakes and his thugs, changed the will, kidnapped and impersonated Doland, kidnapped Brenda, threatened Clark, dug up parts of town, battled Loosha, and attempted to destroy the town. He did not find the Golden Garden.
    Eternal Diva - Melina died the year before, Descole built the Detragan (Detra-Gigant) and used Oswald Whistler to make his grand production, events take two days
    Miracle Mask - Masked Gentleman has been in town a month before Layton and co. show. Right when he appeared, the ‘mask’ was stolen from the Ledore home (hanging in plain sight in Henry’s study, probably through a window)
    Azran Legacy
    Curious Village - Events take 2 days, and are not public.
    Diabolical Box  - Schrader sent the letter two days previous, get on the train soon after, three hours in Dropstone, get knocked out, nighttime, wander around Folsense, fall asleep again, it ends the next morning. So about one full day (Sophia died the year before, and 50th anniversary for the town and the train)
    Unwound Future - Demonstration took place the week before, events take one day
