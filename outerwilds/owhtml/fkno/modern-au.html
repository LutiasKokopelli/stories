<!-- @SFOLD Context & Intro -->
<!-- <div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Disclaimer:</h1><p>Even more in this AU than in the others (and this is saying something), the whys and hows for the entire worldbuilding here are extremely wobbly, based on vibes and “Do not think about it too hard” alone, and the only two reasons any work was put into it at all are the following:</p><ol><li>The setup and the way it grew in the span of just a few days gave a few opportunities for new shenanigans that break all known laws of physics, but are funny and/or good for drama?</li><li>I have, unfortunately, very good and amazing friends. And a massive enabler named <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/users/merrydock/pseuds/merrydock>merrydock</a> who would not let me forget about this AU even if I tried.</li></ol><p>So, uh, yeah, just don’t ask why Hearthians in this new universe have their culture based off the stereotypical Western capitalist system or whatever this is supposed to be, or whether “Area 22” is real or not (it’s most likely not, Firn just watches too many sci-fi movies).</p><p><i>Some</i> elements in the History of this world are supposed to make sense, but most of pretty much everything, especially the “quantum” shenanigans that the Eye does through Hal, is really just “the author thought it’d be funny/interesting/good for drama/made it in because of her enabler/insert random and 100% subjective reason.”</p></div> -->
<div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Story Context:</h1>
    <ul><p class=hudgrey><u>Origin:</u> This AU took inspiration from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the Campfire Discord server had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in fancy modern clothes.</p></ul>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p align=center><i>Ye who entered the Eye, shall now become the Eye.</i></p>
    <p align=center><i>A new world needs to be made; its laws trust your judgment.</i></p>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p>After going to the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> at the end of FKNO, a new universe is created following Hal’s dearest wishes for the future… as well as their grief for a past cut short too soon. Hal slumbers with the lingering regret that Hearthians were not given the chance to prosper as a species, not only due to the supernova and the heat death of the universe, but even before then, because of the regular dangers of Timber Hearth which had continuously dwindled both the population of Hearthians and the planet’s biodiversity as a whole.</p>
    <p>14.3 billion years later, the Hearthian solar system has reformed in a <i>similar enough</i> shape to how it used to be in the previous universe, albeit in a way such that it fits the new laws of physics introduced with this new universe — which are, on the surface level at least, exactly the same as our own’s. As a consequence, the sun and planets are now much bigger and much further apart from each other, and planets are now capable of handling much larger, richer, thicker atmospheres.</p>
    <p>Moreover, following Hal’s wishes for safety and prosperity, any source of natural disasters that could be tamed or avoided entirely has been either erased or diminished in order to be far less deadly than they used to be. To quote MAU Firn upon learning about this: “…So you made it boring on purpose.”</span></p>
    <details open class=hudgrey style='padding:.5em 1.7em'><summary><u>This includes the following changes:</u></summary><ul>
        <li>Though <span class=lblue>the Interloper</span> did get captured by the sun’s gravity, ghost matter has been erased from existence, and therefore it is only a regular comet made out of good old ice and rock, with no exotic particles involved.</li>
        <li>The “bramble” as a plant species does not exist; therefore, the fifth planet in the solar system is still intact, and it has been named “<span class=lblue>Distant Brine</span>” (in order to keep the DB acronym for some semblance of clarity).</li>
        <li>The geysers on <span class=lblue>Timber Hearth</span> are no longer powerful enough to send objects and people into orbit. If only because they are, relatively to the size of the planet itself, much smaller.</li>
        <li><span class=lblue>Giant’s Deep</span>’s cyclones are far less common and powerful.</li>
        <li>The volcanic activity of <span class=lblue>Hollow’s Lantern</span> is either much more tame (none of its projectiles can leave the moon’s own gravity), or entirely dormant.</li>
        <li><span class=lblue>Brittle Hollow</span>… It hasn’t yet been decided, but it is likely that it in fact does <i>not</i> contain a black hole (and its rock composition, while still very intriguing for different reasons, does not hold any latent gravitational distortion properties), and that the solar system’s white hole no longer exists. It may also be the case because of this universe’s new laws of physics — chances are warping via black/white hole pairs isn’t going to be compatible with life anymore, if feasible at all. That part is still a moot point.</li>
        <li>Also a sort of moot point, but it’s likely that the <span class=lblue>Hourglass Twins</span>’ sand exchange is no longer a thing. Not yet decided whether this means that Ash Twin is forever buried under piles of sand, or whether said sand does not exist at all.</li>
        <li>Finally: for reasons yet unknown, the <span class=lblue>Eye of the universe</span> is currently absent from this solar system. This means that although both the Owlks and Nomai still exist out there, <b class=orng>neither the Stranger nor the Vessel ever came to visit</b>.</li>
    </ul></details>
    <p>With all this, Hearthian society has been able to develop and grow to a much larger scale than in the previous universe, with their daily lives being now close to stereotypical human 21st century Western culture (not yet decided on how close it would get to actual human Earth, it is… massive. I am not ready to delve into the topic of countries or multiple cultures and all that and there are a lot of real world things I. do not want to think about fjdkslmgjmsqdk. I just want this AU to be about the slice-of-life shenanigans of Hearthians trying to live their daily lives in a world that has capitalism and Youtube).</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, Hearthian technology is more advanced in this universe than it was in the previous one; on the other hand, the absence of Nomai ruins to explore and tinker with (alongside the new scales of the planets and space between them) has ironically slowed down their spacefaring progress. Although Outer Wilds Ventures is pretty much the Hearthian equivalent of NASA, <b class=orng>no living being has yet been sent into space</b> (not for a lack of trying from Feldspar).</p>
    <p>And with the context now fully given, the story can begin:</p>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p>Hal, after slumbering for 14.3 billion years, awakens one day on this new Timber Hearth. They are already confused by the fact alone that they are somehow still alive, but this new universe has even more surprises to come. First and foremost, as they soon meet with this world’s versions of Firn and Hornfels, another discovery soon leaves them in shock:</p>
    <p>According to this new Hearthian society, they never existed.</p>

<div class=shiplog id=int_><p>Little warning: Since this is first and foremost an AU based off vibes and fun Discord conversations, it is currently a gigantic mess. Drawing comics takes an awfully long time too, so you should not expect the highest quality by any means, and you should in fact be pleasantly surprised when you happen to see a scene occur in chronological order uninterrupted for more than a single page. Sorry for that, fingers crossed for me to find the time and inspiration to fill in the blanks sooner rather than later!</p></div>
