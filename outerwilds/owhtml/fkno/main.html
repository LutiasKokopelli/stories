<div class=hudgreen><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Main Timeline:</b> <i>Fate Knows No One</i></u></summary><ul>
<li><i>Fate Knows No One</i> is a fanfic based on a very simple idea: Hal gets paired with the museum’s statue instead of the newest astronaut.</li>
<li>This fanfic can be read either on this website (for the full experience), or on AO3 (still the same good read, you just don’t get to have <i>all</i> of the cool formatting effects even though honestly there isn’t <i>that</i> much of a difference in the aesthetics):</li>

<div class=hudblue><details open><summary><u>Hearthian Culture</u></summary><ul>
<li><b class=blue>Time Measurements:</b> For the sake of having more elaborate plots and more time for the characters to develop (then un-develop all over again), the time loop lasts 220 human minutes (+ 400 seconds) instead of 22 (+ 40 seconds). For more details, you can read <a href=../fknodoc/loremap.html#OGHeaCalendar class='black purplel' target=_blank>this lore card</a>detailing the main specifics of the Hearthian calendar according to FKNO.</li>

<!--@SFOLD — Ship AUs-->
<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>“X Gets Stuck Inside Firn’s Ship Log” AUs</h1>
<p>In all cases, this idea stems from the fact that Firn’s ship log retains its information throughout the loops via the exact same system as any living being who was included in the Ash Twin Project. Which led to the following hypothetical question: What if a pairing goes wrong, and though the memories are successfully collected, the Ash Twin Project is somehow unable to send them to their intended owner?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of ATP shenanigans could lead to a huge range of unexpected results, notably body-swapping and whatnot. But somehow giving endless trauma to Hearthian hatchlings by turning them into ships sounded more fun.</p>
<p>I 100% blame the fanfic <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/52388716 target=_blank class='black orng2'><i>to dream rewritten dreams</i></a>for this. If you have read it, you may find the connection. If you haven’t, go read it and you might see.</p>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Separate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Firn AU”</u></summary><ul>
<li>This AU would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until the events of Loop 9.</li>
<li>The exact circumstances surrounding the setup are set in stone and detailed, but since they would spoil the future of FKNO… I would rather not give too many details for now hahaha.</li>
<li>I have written a bunch of stuff for it in the form of fanfic excerpts, but I have yet to format them in a satisfying manner… and, again, spoilers for regular FKNO make me reluctant to post much about it for the time being.</li>
</ul></details></div>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Separate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Hal AU”</u></summary><ul>
<li>This AU branched off the Ship Firn AU, and is a little more… hand-wavey regarding how exactly it happens.</li>
<li>It would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until Loop 8, during which Firn decides to tinker with the museum’s statue instead of doing what they would have normally done at this point in regular FKNO.</li>
<li>By the magic of “Who cares about how it happens, if you’re reading this then all you are interested in is the consequences,” Firn accidentally activates the statue and causes it to pair with them as well, despite the fact that this statue was already paired with Hal.</li>
<li>Both hatchlings immediately know that this does not bode well for the next loops, and try to mentally brace themselves for what may happen next time there is a supernova; however, Hal being removed from the Ash Twin Project while their memories are still saved, and then having said memories be sent to Firn’s ship log instead, was definitely not part of the list.</li>

<!--@SFOLD — Modern AU-->
<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>Post-Loop AUs</h1><div class=hudblue id=mau><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Alternate Universe:</b> Modern AU</u></summary><ul>
<li>So… This is a big one. This AU took inspiration from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/ target=_blank class='black orng2'><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/ target=_blank class='black orng2'><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the Campfire Discord server had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in fancy modern clothes. It started small as just a fun shitpost in a friend’s DMs, but then it accidentally grew into something that ended up being even bigger than the main fanfic series it was supposed to be a non-canon spin-off of.</li>
<li>The idea started simple enough: after entering the <span class=lblue>Eye of the universe</span>, Hal created a universe which, after 14.3 billion years, ended up with a similar enough recreation of the Hearthian solar system, except the new planets and their occupants abide by this new universe’s laws of physics — which, on the surface level, are far closer to our own than the previous one’s were.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, as the Original Observer who gave birth to the new universe and whose constant observation is still required in order to keep it thriving, Hal has been slumbering and dreaming, drifting in space. That is, until they were caught in Timber Hearth’s gravity and crashed right in front of two Hearthians who are in no manner acquaintainces… and yet not quite strangers, either. At least, from Hal’s perspective.</li>
<p><a href=fknomau.html target=_blank class=in>» You can read more about this AU and see how far the comic for it has progressed on Github.</a></p></ul></details></div>
