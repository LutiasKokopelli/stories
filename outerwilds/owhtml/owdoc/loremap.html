<!--@SFOLD✔️Lore Map-->
<details><summary><h2>So what is a “lore map” exactly?</h2></summary>
<p>The short answer – This is what happens when you’re investigating Pepe Silvia but don’t own a corkboard.</p>
<p>The long answer is that it aims to be a mine of information and lore (in the case of this web page specifically, all revolving around the fictional world described in Outer Wilds), organized in such way that there is no particular order to the information you are given, but that you can filter in and out specific topics until all that remains is only what you are looking for.</p>
<p>This project has some similarities with a wiki, but is fundamentally different in how it functions: where a wiki will create articles, the lore map will create multiple independent lore cards, each stating one or two facts at most. Depending on the user, what may make the use of lore cards somewhat more useful than one lengthy, varied and detailed article per general topic (e.g. character or location) is that the tag system makes it easier to truly narrow your search down to exactly what you want to read about – while a wiki article makes it far easier to get distracted because of equally fascinating but ultimately unrelated tangents, lose track of time, and maybe even forget what you were looking for in the first place.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee that the lore map will not end up being a rabbit hole of its own, but I do hope that it will at the very least end up being a <i>different</i> kind of rabbit hole. At the very least, what I can promise is that this rabbit hole should not end up creating hundreds of new tabs on your browser (unless you manually copy and paste every lore card’s specific URL in a series of new tabs).</p>
<p>Another goal of this lore map is to reunite conciseness and thoroughness, as paradoxical as it sounds. A lore card’s title will be a summary which should be enough all on its own to convey the main piece of information; once opened, the rest of the lore card may then provide additional details, clarifications, and most importantly, the exact source(s): instructions on how to find it in the game (including current patch, older patches, alphas…), or which interview said it (with timestamp), or which book, et c&aelig;tera. Where a wiki will usually keep all sources for the very end of the article and limit digressions in order to remain readable, the lore map is designed to dynamically allow or prevent every digression relevant to a very specific topic in its own specific space. In particular, since each fact is given its own lore card, this ensures that everything is given a precise source.</p>
<p class=orng><b>The principle in short:</b> Select a few tags, a couple lore cards will appear. Refine your search by adding or excluding more tags, look at what remains, rinse and repeat until you find a list of lore cards providing all the answers you seek.</p>
<p>Of note: I (Lutias Kokopelli) am the only person who can edit this web page, which is an obvious caveat compared to community-built wikis. However, I care about the quality of this project, and I encourage people willing to help make it more complete and reliable to contact me for even the tiniest complaint. The lore map has its own <a href=https://discord.gg/knBDpGAjNF target=_blank class=blue>Discord server</a> in which I introduce every lore card I am about to implement to the web page, and let everyone interested debate everything about it — its wording, its tags (or whether tags in general need an overhaul of some kind), whether or not parts of it are too confusing or too speculative, and so on.</p></details>
<!--@EFOLD-->
<!--@SFOLD✔️Tags-->
<details><summary><h2>Tags: How to find and use them</h2></summary>
<p>Tags are the crux of the lore map’s true power: thanks to them, this project works not as a static wiki page, but instead as an interactable database that you can update anytime as you read. Each lore card is given a list of tags, and will be either shown or hidden depending on the tags (and <a href="javascript:document.querySelector('#loremapsmode').closest('details').open=true;document.getElementById('loremapsmode').scrollIntoView()">search mode & logic</a>) you selected.</p>
<p>Considering the sheer number of tags available, the blue text box on top of the list of tags (the first element you will see below this tutorial) can be used in order to type a tag’s contents and automatically hide any that does not fit your request. You don’t have to type entire words, let alone guess a tag’s exact wording – the page will show you all tags which <i>contain</i> the fragments you type. You can even type multiple fragments separated by spaces: somehow, typing “rt he” will show you the tags “#chert” and “#timber hearth” (among others). This will not save you from typos, but it comes as close to it as it can get.</p>
<hr>
<p>A tag will typically look like <input type=button value=#this style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .3em;margin-top:-.3em'>. If you see an orange tag like <input type=button value=#this class=maclude style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .3em;margin-top:-.3em'> instead, then this specific tag has yet to be associated with any lore card – though, depending on the circumstances, this does not quite mean that it is entirely useless.</p>
<p>In order to modulate a tag’s effect on your search, simply click on it.</p>
<h2 style='color:rgb(var(--white));padding:0 5%;margin:0 auto'>Order of activation:</h2>
<p align=center style=margin-bottom:2em><input type=button value=neutral style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .5em;margin-top:-.3em'> &rarr; <input type=button class=include value='include in the search' style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .5em;margin-top:-.3em'> &rarr; <input type=button class=exclude value='exclude from the search' style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .5em;margin-top:-.3em'> &rarr; <input type=button value=neutral style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .5em;margin-top:-.3em'></p>
<p>Some tags are more specific than others (e.g. “#ash twin” vs “#hourglass twins”), and sometimes, the topics of two or more tags overlap. The way lore cards and tags are designed tries to account for this by making it so that tags are less a list of unrelated strings of text, and rather a network of sorts. Tags with a precise topic (e.g.&nbsp;“#chert”) may also link to other tags which are related, but also more vague (e.g. “#hearthians” or “#astronauts”).</p>
<p><b>What this means in practice:</b><ul>
<li>If a lore card is about a very specific topic (for example, “Esker has pink eyes”), then it will come with equally specific tags (such as “#esker”).</li>
<li>If a lore card encompasses multiple entities at once (for example, “Hearthians have four eyes”), then it will come with a broader tag (“#hearthians”) but <i>not</i> with the whole list of more specific tags (The tag “#esker” and all other 21 Hearthian character tags will not be listed).</li>
<li>And yet, Esker is a Hearthian: therefore, what you will observe if you decide to activate the tag “#esker” is that the lore card “Hearthians have four eyes” will also appear – even if the tag “#hearthians” is absent from your list of active tags.<ul><li><b>Tip:</b> If you hover your mouse over a tag like <input type=button value='#this'title='Related tags (will appear in orange):
  • #tag A is related
  • #also tag B'style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .3em;margin-top:-.3em'>, a list of all the related tags which will be added in this “passive” way will be displayed. If no such list appears, then the tag has no documented relations.</li></ul></li>
<li>If you are not interested in the kind of lore that regards all Hearthians indiscriminately, you can look at the tags of a lore card that isn’t relevant to Esker specifically: the tag “#hearthians” will be <orng>orange</orng> instead of white or light green. In order to get rid of lore cards that appeared because of an unwanted orange tag, one option is to click on this orange tag twice (first to turn it green, then to turn it red and thus exclude it from the search).</li>
<li><b>Of note:</b> Changing the <a href="javascript:document.querySelector('#loremapsmode').closest('details').open=true;document.getElementById('loremapsmode').scrollIntoView()">search mode</a> to “FOCUS” will disregard <i>all</i> orange tags. If you are however interested in keeping at least one or two orange tags (for example, while “#hearthians” is too vague, seeing results for “#lunar outpost” still interests you), you have two options: keep the search mode as BROAD and turn all the unwanted tags red, or (provided the <a href="javascript:document.querySelector('#loremaplogic').closest('details').open=true;document.getElementById('loremaplogic').scrollIntoView()">search logic</a> is ANY instead of ALL) turn all the tags of interest green and change the search mode to FOCUS.</li>
</ul></p>
<hr>
<p>A rather vague tag (e.g. “#hearthians”) may be preceded by a circular button like in <button style=vertical-align:top><m title='This will also toggle the following tags:
  • #this tag
  • #that one
  • #this tag too'></m><input type=button value='#this case'title='Related tags (will appear in orange):
  • #tag A is related
  • #or maybe tag B'style='border-radius:20px;font-size:1.3em;font-weight:500;font-family:BrandonGrotesque;padding:0 .3em;padding-left:1.7em'></button>.</p>
<p>The tag itself will behave as normal, but the circular button has an action of its own: clicking on it will not only activate the tag it is attached to, but also actively toggle (turn green/red or remove from the list) multiple other tags which are thematically related to the topic mentioned by the tag itself. In the case of the generic tag “#hearthians”, clicking on its associated circular button will activate the tag “#hearthians” <i>as well as</i> all 22 tags corresponding to all 22 Hearthian characters.</p>
<p>Similarly to normal tags, hovering over a tag’s circular button will display the list of tags that it controls (aside from the tag it is linked to, which is implied to be part of the list by default).</p>
<p>Needless to say, this circular button only has its uses when you wish to explore the lore at large (and are using “ANY” as your search logic; setting “ALL” instead will return no results).</p>
</details>
<!--@EFOLD-->
<!--@SFOLD✔️Search Bar-->
<details><summary><h2>Search Bar: Manage your results</h2></summary>
<p>Below the table listing all tags available stands the search bar: it will provide you with a quick access to your active tags and multiple features which will help refine your search. From left to right, the search bar is composed of the following elements:</p><ul>
<li>The list and state of all currently active tags. Each tag shown in this space is a button of its own, which functions the exact same way as the original tags (including the possibility to show you the list of orange tags it may be connected to if you hover them).</li>
<li><span class style='background:rgb(var(--goldd));padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>Open/Close All</span> lets you expand or collapse all lore cards at once.</li>
<li><span class style='background:rgb(var(--redd));padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>Reset</span> erases the search bar’s contents and the state of all tags. The show/conceal state of Echoes of the Eye spoilers and the search mode & logic will not be reset.</li>
<li><span class style='background:rgb(var(--indigod));padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>Echoes of the Eye</span> spoilers can be toggled on or off. When DLC spoilers are toggled off, concealed lore cards will still be displayed in a heavily blurred state: this is meant to notify you of their existence, without them actually being readable unless you allow DLC spoilers.</li>
<li id=loremapsmode><span class style='background:#bd652a;padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>BROAD | FOCUS</span> defines the <b>search mode</b>: “BROAD” will allow the appearance of additional lore cards which contain none of the green tags, but do contain at least one related tag (appearing in orange). “FOCUS” will prevent those extra lore cards from being shown.</li>
<li id=loremaplogic><span class style='background:rgb(var(--greend));padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>ANY | ALL</span> defines the <b>search logic</b>: the lore map’s results will return cards which are marked with “ANY” (at least one) or “ALL” of the green tags (and NONE of the red tags).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If you want to see every single lore card available, you can simply toggle either the orange BROAD/FOCUS button or the green ANY/ALL button while the tag selection is empty.</p></details>
<!--@EFOLD-->
<!--@SFOLD✔️Save/Load-->
<details><summary><h2>Save/Load your search state</h2></summary>
<p>I have bad news – unlike your ship’s computer, this web page is not connected to the Ash Twin Project. If it is reloaded, it will forget <b>everything</b>. This means that if you have spent a long time perfecting your tags and search mode/logic before finally finding the list of lore cards you would like to keep under your watch for later use, you had better memorize every option you picked and prepare yourself mentally to later painstakingly find and toggle every tag and option <i>again</i>…</p>
<p>…or not! Thankfully, right below the search bar lay two buttons with a black text box in the middle: clicking on the leftmost button while you have multiple tags active will display a string of text that you can copy and paste in your own notes for safekeeping. Again, the web page itself will not save anything – you have to copy the text it gives you (the icon in the top right corner lets you add it to your clipboard in one click) and save it in your own files.</p>
<div style=max-width:800px;margin:auto;position:relative><pre style=padding:1em;white-space:pre-wrap;background:rgba(var(--goldd),.7);text-align:left>supernova1,high energy lab1,sunless city0,FOCUS,ANY,</pre><clp style=top:.3em;right:.1em><btn onclick=CopyCodeToClipboard(this) onmouseleave=ResetCopyCode(this)><msg style=width:64px;margin-left:-32px>Copy</msg></btn></clp></div>
<p>What you have above is an example of what you could call a “save point” for the lore map. The tags “#supernova” and “#high energy lab” will be added and turned green (because of the “1” at the end), the tag “#sunless city” will be added in red (because of the final “0”), and the search will be set to use the FOCUS mode and ANY logic.</p>
<p>If you reload this web page, the list of active tags will be empty and all your options will be reset: but if you paste the text you saved into the black box and then click on the rightmost button, all your progress will be loaded back in. Scrolling aside, it will be as if you had never left!</p>
<hr>
<p>…What do you <i>mean</i>, “scrolling aside”? Scrolling is tedious and annoying! What if you were looking through the ENTIRE map with an empty tag selection and hundreds of lore cards displayed? That doesn’t solve anything!</p>
<p>I got you good, didn’t I? Well, fortunately, there is a trick the earlier example conveniently forgot to mention. See how it ends with a comma? Why would it end with a comma with nothing coming after? …Well, because there is an optional element that can be added to your “save point.”</p>
<p>Every lore card has its own identifier, which you can copy by clicking on this icon <img src=../ast/svg/copy-url.svg style='filter:invert(1);height:1.2em;margin:-.2em 0'> (you will find it at the bottom right corner of the lore card, on the same level as its list of tags). If you first click on this icon in order to get a lore card’s ID (ideally the one you were in the midst of reading), then click on “Copy current tag list,” then the save point will be updated to contain this lore card’s ID – and submitting this save point will then have the page automatically scroll down to that lore card’s location. Here is a “save point” which uses a specific lore card’s ID as a bookmark of sorts:</p>
<div style=max-width:800px;margin:auto;position:relative><pre style=padding:1em;white-space:pre-wrap;background:rgba(var(--goldd),.7);text-align:left>supernova1,high energy lab1,sunless city0,FOCUS,ANY,#datasupernova</pre><clp style=top:.3em;right:.1em><btn onclick=CopyCodeToClipboard(this) onmouseleave=ResetCopyCode(this)><msg style=width:64px;margin-left:-32px>Copy</msg></btn></clp></div>
<p>You can only keep one lore card’s ID as your bookmark (the page cannot scroll to multiple places simultaneously). You can click on as many IDs as you want without causing any issue, but know that only the last ID you interacted with will be kept in memory.</p>

<!--@SFOLD✔️Lore cards-->
<details><summary><h2>Lore cards: Facts and Sources</h2></summary>
<p>Lore cards are what your selection of tags will fish out of the depths of this web page. As their name suggests, they are somewhat shaped like flashcards, and more importantly, they contain the lore you seek. Some lore cards may have their own quirks in terms of the way the information they contain is presented, but they all follow the same global structure:</p>
<it id=LoreCardExample style='max-width:800px;margin:1em auto'><details class=reg><summary>This title provides a summary of what the lore card aims to teach/remind you.<br>Click to see what’s inside!</summary>
<p>This section is normally hidden by default, and only revealed when you click on the lore card’s title: this method lets you open and close it at will. Alternatively, the <span class style='background:rgb(var(--goldd));padding:3px 7px;font-weight:800;color:rgb(var(--white))'>Open/Close All</span> button located next to the active tags selection bar will let you toggle the open/closed state of all lore cards at once.</p>
<p>This section’s purpose is to reveal supplementary information in regards to the fact the lore card’s summary provides: notably the exact source and quotes from the game, or images, or even tables with numbers and some math when relevant.</p>
<p>Usually, the lore card’s title is stating a fact, while the content hidden within justifies this fact by providing the proof supporting it (whether in-game dialogue or observations, interviews, previous patches of the game, or other sources).</p>
</details><t><input type=button value='#Here are some tags!'> <input type=button value='#These ones aren’t functional'style=color:rgb(var(--orng))> <input type=button value='#but a real lore card’s tags can be interacted with.'></t>
<clp><btn onclick=CopyLinkToClipboard(this) onmouseleave=ResetCopyLink(this)><msg>Copy Card URL</msg></btn></clp></it>
<p>The purpose of a lore card is to be all at once succinct (by reading its title alone), exhaustive (by providing as many details, screenshots, external links, graphs etc as necessary under the cut), and reliable in the sense that every piece of information it provides must have a verifiable source.</p>
<p>Lore cards will often give obvious information that is sometimes outright stated in the game: this is part of its exact purpose, to be a reminder of both the obvious and the less obvious. Notably, the lore map aims to remain as impartial and purely factual as possible. Speculation is intended to be kept to the bare minimum, if present at all; and any piece of speculation that may slip in must make it obvious that it is based on a combination of various other facts, rather than an officially confirmed statement.</p>
<p>Some lore cards (notably the “General Data: X” cards) may become quite long and packed with information; but in most cases, it is preferable for the sake of keeping a more accurate tagging system to keep them as succinct as possible, and sometimes to split various details of a piece of information into multiple separate lore cards referencing each other. The inspiration behind lore cards was flashcards, after all! There is not much ‘flash’ left to it if it takes a dozen minutes to read just one, let alone if only a small fraction of its contents is related to what you are looking for.</p></details>
<!--@EFOLD-->
<!--@SFOLD✔️Lore cards Bonus Features-->
<details><summary><h2>Lore cards’ Bonus Features</h2></summary>
<h4>Cross references</h4>
<p>Sometimes, a lore card will refer to another. If you see this symbol <img src=../ast/svg/hud_dlg.svg style=height:1em;margin-bottom:-.1em>, then clicking on it or the text preceding it will let you access the lore card in question.</p>
<h4>Hidden details</h4>
<p>Some lore cards may contain even more information than you would suspect at first glance. If this information is not so easily visible, then it normally would only be redundant or minor details that most people would consider insignificant – for example, ship log entries which are unlocked by reading a given Nomai dialogue, but which are simply repeating word for word said Nomai dialogue.</p>
<p>Still, what one considers useless information, another may judge noteworthy; and as such, the lore map yearns to remain as exhaustive as possible… without being too cluttered for the sake of the majority who wants to get to the point. If you see this symbol <span class=infoa><img src=../ast/svg/hud_m2e.svg style=height:1.2em;margin-bottom:-.2em><span class=infob>Yep, just like this!</span></span> during your search, then try to hover or click on it! <span class=orng>There’s more to explore here.</span></p>
<h4>Quick share</h4>
<p>If you wish to share a certain lore card’s contents with a friend (or bookmark it when paired with the “save point” feature), you <i>could</i> send them a screenshot… or, an arguably faster and handier version, you can simply click on this icon <img src=../ast/svg/copy-url.svg style='filter:invert(1);height:1.2em;margin:-.2em 0'> then instantly copy the lore card’s personalized URL to your clipboard! Every lore card possesses this icon in their bottom right corner, on the same row as the list of tags.</p>
<p>Clicking on a lore card’s personalized link will load this exact page, except the lore card of interest will already be visible, open, and even highlighted for a short instant.</p>

<details><summary><h2>Lore card types: Color Chart</h2></summary>
<p>Lore cards come in one of five different colors, each meant to hint at some hierarchy in terms of the reliability/canonicity of the information they provide. From most reliable to entirely retconned:</p><div style='column-count:auto;column-gap:1em;column-width:540px;padding:0 1em'>
<div class=lorecard style=--fore:var(--greend);--midd:var(--greenl)><h3 style=--fore:var(--greend);--midd:var(--greenl)>Regular Lore Card</h3>
<p>This lore card color is for information revealed through normal gameplay, notably through the in-game dialogue.</p>
</div>
<div class=lorecard style=--fore:var(--goldd);--midd:var(--goldl)><h3 style=--fore:var(--goldd);--midd:var(--goldl)>Time Loop Scripted Events &&nbsp;Gameplay Observations</h3>
<p>This lore card color, as well as the associated tag <code style=font-size:.7em;color:rgb(var(--orng))>#in-game&nbsp;observations</code>, is for information which is not stated explicitly, but can be observed in-game. This includes the measured timing of scripted events, size of and distances between objects, etc. Any time stamp provided considers time 0 as the moment when the “Wake up” button is pressed at the start of a loop.</p>
</div>
<div class=lorecard style=--fore:var(--indigod);--midd:var(--indigol)><h3 style=--fore:var(--indigod);--midd:var(--indigol)>Alternate Official Sources</h3>
<p>This lore card color is for information revealed through official sources such as merchandise or interviews post game release, provided the information being revealed is meant by the developers to still be canon, and provided it has not been retconned by later sources.</p>
<p>All lore cards of this color come with the following tag: <code style=font-size:.7em;color:rgb(var(--orng))>#alternate&nbsp;sources</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class=lorecard style=--fore:var(--greyd);--midd:var(--greyl)><h3 style=--fore:var(--greyd);--midd:var(--greyl)>Unused & Concept Art</h3>
<p>This lore card color is for information revealed exclusively through concept art or content which did not make it into the final game (e.g. information exclusive to the Alpha or previous patches of the game).</p>
<p>Due to the fact that this content is either absent or was deliberately removed from the game, information provided through those means is therefore of debatable, or even dubious canonicity; however, if the lore card is of this color instead of red, then no blatant contradiction has been found with confirmed canon elements.</p>
<p>All lore cards of this color come with the following tag: <code style=font-size:.7em;color:rgb(var(--orng))>#unused/concept&nbsp;art</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class=lorecard style=--fore:var(--redd);--midd:var(--redl)><h3 style=--fore:var(--redd);--midd:var(--redl)>Retconned</h3>
<p>This lore card color is for information which was present in either concept art or previous versions of the game (including the alphas) and which can no longer be considered accurate in regards to new in-game information.</p>
<p>All lore cards of this color come with the following tag: <code style=display:inline-block;font-size:.7em;color:rgb(var(--orng))>#retconned</code>.</p>

<!--@SFOLD☑️Example-->
<details><summary><h2>Cool, cool. So how do I use it?</h2></summary>
<p style=font-size:1em>Let’s take two diametrically opposed examples:</p>
<p style=font-size:1.1em;font-weight:600>You’re trying to learn everything there is to know about the Nomai from Brittle Hollow.</p><ol>
<li>You are here to read, and you probably want as many results as possible – or at least, you want to avoid taking the risk of hiding lore cards you would like to see. Make sure that you are using the ANY search logic.</li>
<li>If you want to read even more, also check whether you are using the BROAD search mode, which will return more results (albeit perhaps less relevant) than the FOCUS mode.</li>
<li>Fortunately for you, there are tags named “#nomai (brittle hollow)” and “#nomai (escape pod 1)” (if you remember your lore, this is the escape pod which crashed on Brittle Hollow). Even better, this tag comes with a circle-shaped button too: if you hover it, you will see a list of the names of all the Nomai who boarded it.</li>
<li>If you want to include the Nomai who were born after the crash, then “#nomai (escape pod 1)” may actually not be the most useful to you, compared to the alternative. However, some of the Nomai listed in “#nomai (brittle hollow)” actually grew up on Ember Twin (which includes Solanum, for example)! They are only part of the list because they went to school there.</li>
<li>Not to worry: there is also a “#nomai (ember twin)” tag, after all, and it comes with its own circle-shaped button. If you click on this circle twice, you will have effectively either turned red or removed entirely the names of the Nomai you don’t want to read about.</li>
</ol>
<p style=font-size:1.1em;font-weight:600>You heard that Chert is supposed to know something about Ash Twin, but you have no idea what it is.</p><ol>
<li>The first step would be to turn the tags “#chert” and “#ash&nbsp;twin” green. This, however, returns a lot of irrelevant results.</li>
<li>You are sure that Chert specifically, knows something about Ash Twin specifically. The kind of lore card you are looking for has to have both tags: so you select the ALL search logic.</li>
<li>That’s better, but you are still seeing some irrelevant lore cards about Hearthians and the Hourglass Twins. The reason they appear is because of the BROAD search mode: but considering your goal, the orange tags are completely useless. Select the FOCUS search mode to make them go away.</li>

<p>This is part of the cons of trying to be as exhaustive as possible: it is better to show too many results than not enough, and take the risk of not showing you the kind of information you would like to see… But this also means that with one tag being connected to another, itself connected to another, and on and on, search results may pile up fast and diverge from your initial topic. In a sense, this lore map is the equivalent of the Wikipedia rabbit hole, except condensed in one single page.</p>
<p>To remedy this, one thing you can do is <b>take a look at your undesired lore cards’ tags</b>. Green and orange tags are the reason the lore card appeared, and more often than not, <b>an <span class=orng>orange</span> tag will be your culprit</b>. To get rid of this and similar lore cards, you can pick any tag in its list and click on it twice, until the lore card disappears! When you find orange or white tags that have nothing to do with what you are looking for, turning them red is the best way to get rid of cards you aren’t interested in without having to impact your actual search.</p> -->
<blockquote style=padding:1em>“This web page layout looks… broken.”</blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry if it does! I am 100% self-taught on HTML/CSS/JS and have only tested my web pages on my computer and phone, which both use Firefox. If you are using a different browser, this may be the cause. If you are or know a web developer who would be willing to help look into and possibly even fix this kind of issue, don’t hesitate to contact me! Just… be nice and don’t insult me too hard for the spaghetti code. I’m doing my best 😅</p>

<h2>Expansion to Red Giant</h2>
<p>The sun’s color gradually changes from the very start of the loop, and its radius progressively grows starting from a certain point in the loop.</p>
<p>The visual observation of a recording of the map locked on to the sun spanning over a full loop showed that the sun’s size <b><i>seems</i></b> static until 10:30, then starts growing in size linearly at a rate of about 3.3&#8239;m/s, and reaches its final size at 20:35, just as the track “End Times” starts playing.</p><p>However, datamining will give a more nuanced evolution of the sun: instead of being fully linear, the sun’s expansion uses a <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep>Smoothstep function</a> which makes it so that the sun’s radius actually starts expanding at <b>10:00</b> at a very slow rate (slow enough to almost not be visually detectable), and to stop expanding at <b>21:00</b> after the expansion rate slowed down drastically.</p>
<h2>Collapse</h2>
<p>The sun collapses in the span of 10&#8239;s, seeing its radius decrease from 4000&#8239;m to 200&#8239;m.</p>
<p style=color:rgb(var(--redl))><i>TBA: Does the sun collapse linearly at a constant speed of 380&#8239;m/s?</i></p>

</table><h2>Supernova Expansion</h2>
<p>The supernova expands following a cubic Bézier curve. It starts at a radius of <b>200&#8239;m</b> at <b>22:10</b> and ends at a radius of <b>50&#8239;km</b> at <b>22:55</b>. The following graph represents the supernova’s radius through time, and gives the approximate timings of the supernova reaching the <i>orbit radius</i> of some astral bodies (meaning that the exact timings may be slightly different from those provided in the table above).</p><img src=../ast-owdoc/svg/supernova.svg>
<h2>After the Supernova</h2><p>The supernova’s aftermath can only be witnessed if the Ash Twin Project is disabled, as the end of its expansion and its eventual extinction only occur past the limits of the time loop.</p><p>Even if the supernova seemingly disappears after a while, going back towards the solar system is still lethal, as the supernova’s hitbox remains active in a radius around the solar system of up to <b>50&#8239;km</b> <span class=source>(<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rss6yp2UaXM'>Greg&nbsp;Boing</a>)</span>.</p>

<p><b>Of note:</b> The sun’s and Attlerock’s gravities decay realistically with a distance factor of 1/r<sup>2</sup>, while all other astral bodies’ are measured with a factor of 1/r instead. This explains why the Attlerock’s mass is actually higher than most other astral bodies’, including Timber Hearth’s.</p>
<p>The Attlerock is tidally locked and in synchronous rotation around Timber Hearth. It passes overhead at the same position in the Hearthian sky every <b>123.6&#8239;s</b>.</p>
<h2>Timber Hearth Solar Eclipses</h2>
<p>The Attlerock passes exactly between the sun and Timber Hearth every <b>176&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.3&#8239;s</b>, thus causing a solar eclipse somewhere on Timber Hearth. There are eight eclipses during the time loop:</p>

<p class=smol><b><sup>1</sup></b> The Quantum Moon will never orbit around Ash Twin, or even around the Hourglass Twins’ barycenter; instead, the Quantum Moon orbits Ember Twin specifically.</p>
<p class=smol><b><sup>2</sup></b> In-game, the Quantum Moon’s Sixth Location is actually set on an orbit around the sun itself with a radius of about 30km, and made (almost) invisible from outside.</p>
<h2>Quantum Moon Orbits</h2>
<p>In-game, whenever the possibilities are collapsed for the Quantum Moon, the following parameters are determined:</p><ul>
    <li>A center for the orbit is chosen among the following: Ember Twin<sup>1</sup>, Timber Hearth, Brittle Hollow, Giant’s Deep, Dark Bramble, or the Sun<sup>2</sup>. The orbit radius is a fixed number for each astral body.<ul><li><b>Of note:</b> If any of the six states has not been chosen over ten times in a row, then it will be forcibly chosen next (unless it’s the Hourglass Twins state and the time loop is nearing its end, see below).</li></ul></li>
    <li>The Quantum Moon is placed at a random position, provided it is at the correct distance from the chosen astral body. This means that two parameters are randomized: the angle between the solar system’s ecliptic plane and the Quantum Moon’s orbit plane (this angle can be any number between 0° and 360°), <i>and</i> the location of the Quantum Moon on this chosen orbit plane (any possible point on the defined circle).</li>
    <li>Finally, the direction in which the Quantum Moon orbits (clockwise or counterclockwise) is randomized as well.</li>
</ul><p class=source>Observations confirmed by @ixrec through datamining</p>
<h2>Quantum Moon Rotation</h2>
<p>If the cloud layer is disabled in-game, it can be observed that the reason why you always land on the Quantum Moon’s south pole is because it will constantly reorient itself during your flight so that your ship will always face the south pole.</p>
<h2>Hourglass Twins’ Early Demise</h2>
<p>Because of the large orbit radius in the case of the Hourglass Twins’ version of the Quantum Moon, it is possible to die engulfed by the expanding sun <i>before</i> the supernova occurs. Starting from <b>15:00</b> in the loop (7&#8239;min before the supernova), the Quantum Moon will no longer be able to appear around the Twins unless you are already standing on it.</p>

<h2 class=tl>In-game Observations</h2>
<p>Just as stated by Poke, warp windows are designed to open when the planetary alignment occurs, with a 5° margin of error.</p>
<p>It is only possible to <i>activate</i> the warp platform starting from the moment when <b>the warp platform aligns with the center of the astral body</b>, and up to the moment when <b>the angle reaches 5°</b>. This margin of error results in an <b>inconsistent warp window duration</b> for any astral body other than the sun or the Hourglass Twins (in which case the circular orbit gives periodicity in both the timing and duration of the warp windows), as the window duration depends on the distance between the warp platform and the astral body.</p>
<h2 class=tl>Obstructing the Warp Platform</h2>
<p><b>Of note:</b> If the warp window is activated but there is an obstruction to prevent the object from actually warping (such as the sand level being too high), then the black hole will remain open for four seconds in total before vanishing, thus remaining open much longer than for the duration of a normal warp window.</p><p>This last observation has been observed multiple times with multiple warp windows in the sun, Brittle Hollow and Giant’s Deep towers, by manually adjusting the sand level so as to obstruct their warp platforms. In every warp window documented, the warp window behaves exactly the same way: <b>The&nbsp;black hole opens in 1&#8239;s, remains open for 2&#8239;s, then takes 1&#8239;s to close</b>.</p>

<p><b>Of note:</b> Alex Beachum mentions loop “9354” instead of “9,318,054” because this interview was led before Patch 1.0.7 — in which one of the narrative changes involved precisely increasing the loop number at which the Nomai probe found the Eye of the universe.<br>The Lore Explorer’s video came out on March 19, 2020; Patch 1.0.6 became available on March 23, and Patch 1.0.7 on June 29.</p>

<p>If the Control module is reached on the same loop as the one during which the Protagonist gets paired with a statue, then <smol>&lt;NbTimeloops&gt;</smol> will display the number <orng>9,318,054</orng>, proving that the statue activated because this is the loop during which the probe found the Eye.</p><hr>
<p>It is of note that the “current trajectory” shown by the in-game projection does not match the trajectory which presumably found the Eye of the Universe: the Eye icon shown during the projection which displays all of the millions of launches of the probe will not be part of the projection for the current loop’s launch, and the orientation of the current loop’s trajectory is still random.</p>
<p>Just like the fact that the first loop’s countdown to the supernova doesn’t start until the Protagonist gets paired with the museum’s statue, this gameplay feature is most likely not accurate to the in-universe lore.</p>
<p><b>Of note:</b> Considering the way the game’s world is constructed, the Eye of the Universe is not part of the same open world as the rest of the solar system: therefore, there is no direction in which the probe could be launched in-game that could lead to it, and its trajectory during the first loop of a new expedition is just as random as any other.</p>
