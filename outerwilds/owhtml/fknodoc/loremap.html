<p>The scale ranges from “0%: Would never ever prank this person no matter the circumstances” to “100%: Would need to be physically incapacitated in order to stop pranking them”:</p>
<table class=freet>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td><div class=rating><input value=0% style=visibility:hidden></div></td><td><i class=spmono>No data available</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Gabbro</td><td><div class=rating><input value=5%></div></td><td>Nothing gets under their skin, they’re just not fun to prank. At least they can still be an element to the setup instead of the actual target… when they’re in the village, that is. Still,&nbsp;at least they do have a sense of humor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Esker</td><td><div class=rating><input value=10%></div></td><td>The pranks are literally meant to cheer them up instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Galena</td><td><div class=rating><input value=15%></div></td><td>The goal is to get the hatchling to open up, not make them even more introverted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mica</td><td><div class=rating><input value=20%></div></td><td>Real rating should actually be much lower. The peaks at 100% corresponding to the few sunrises each day spent away from Slate’s workshop are a statistical anomaly and should not have been counted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hal</td><td><div class=rating><input value=30%></div></td><td>Most mean-spirited pranks are solely in order not to lose face. Thankfully Hal knows this and doesn’t take it <i>too</i> hard. Usually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arkose</td><td><div class=rating><input value=35%></div></td><td>The rating would be a lot higher if the hatchling weren’t gravitating so close to ghost matter all the time. Chances are Arkose sticks around that area specifically for that reason (nah, probably not).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chert</td><td><div class=rating><input value=35%></div></td><td>The rating would be a lot higher if only they were on planet more often. The temptation to reorder their charts in reverse-alphabetical order the moment they’re not looking is so, <i>so</i> strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Riebeck</td><td><div class=rating><input value=40%></div></td><td>They take the jokes well, really! They’re so tense all the time, jumpscares should literally be a medical prescription to scare the pressure out of them at least twice a day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slate</td><td><div class=rating><input value=45%></div></td><td>Huh. That’s a surprisingly low rating for an adult full of sass who can defend themself just fine. Wonder what’s up with that.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Porphy</td><td><div class=rating><input value=50%></div></td><td>Beware: messing with the cook/apothecary too little too often has a tendency to make sap wine-related digestive challenges magically spawn inside your dinner plate. Keep it perfectly balanced, as all things should be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tephra</td><td><div class=rating><input value=50%></div></td><td>Hey, they take the pranks well! They’re a fast learner, too, Firn can’t wait for the time when they will have to actually watch their back around them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tuff</td><td><div class=rating><input value=55%></div></td><td>It’s… a guilty pleasure. Firn does feel a little bad that Tuff is ranking so high. The location of their workplace is literally making them <i>beg</i> for it, though!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tektite</td><td><div class=rating><input value=65%></div></td><td>Firn will mostly hold back because of the injured leg and the fact that Tektite is often around dangerous terrain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gneiss</td><td><div class=rating><input value=70%></div></td><td>The stuff they work with is too fragile to prank around… but make for <i>such</i> perfect settings for tiny tools playing hide-and-seek.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Moraine</td><td><div class=rating><input value=70%></div></td><td>Hatchling wants to be a grown-up. They get the grown-up average rating.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Marl</td><td><div class=rating><input value=75%></div></td><td>Firn will more often team up with them for double the hijinks, instead of targeting them specifically. That being said, turning off friendly fire was never an option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spinel</td><td><div class=rating><input value=90%></div></td><td>The ten percents of peace are the rare cases when they got a catch and need to focus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gossan</td><td><div class=rating><input value=95%></div></td><td>Firn loves them, really, but… It’s also kind of personal. Firn doesn’t want to think about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hornfels</td><td><div class=rating><input value=100%></div></td><td>Their angry face as they are trying to hold it together is just <i>so</i> funny. How can you resist?</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rutile</td><td><div class=rating><input value=100%></div></td><td>Nothing personal, they just happen to be the mayor 😔 Collateral damage.</td></tr>

<!--@SFOLD❌Hearthian reproduction system-->
<it wip id=HeaReproductionBiology class=misc><details><summary>Hearthians’ reproduction system is weird and alien and can be roughly summarized to “Eggs magically appear in a pond.”</summary>
    <p align=center><i>(Look I know how this sounds without context but please hear me out)</i></p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> This lore card specifically details the concept in the case of the vanilla FKNO universe (prior to Hearthians entering the Eye of the universe). Hearthians from other universes will have differences regarding the exact anatomy of both hatchlings and adults due to the different laws of physics and environments, but the general logic behind the reproduction itself remains the same.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Long story short: Hearthians have no clue what a <i>sexual</i> relationship is (though they do know romance), and have no clear concept of a “parent” in the biological sense or even of genealogy as a whole, because what reproduction entails is just “go to The Pond&trade; instead of the bathroom once a year” and a few months later they just see eggs floating in the water and some Hearthians come with their nets to pick them up. You may think of coral reproduction as an example.</p>
    <hr><p>For the quick rundown into the microscopic scale:</p><ul>
        <li>Hearthian eggs can have <i>way</i> more than only two parents genetically speaking. While submerged in water, multiple proto-eggs will meet each other and occasionally merge, trade and mix around their genetic information, then discard the surplus until there is one complete genome. This genome is made out of random fractions coming from all proto-eggs involved.</li>
        <li>To prevent accidental inbreeding, proto-eggs use among other things an antigen/antibody recognition system which repels and stops proto-eggs from merging if they are too similar to each other. The more different the genomes, the higher the chance of the two proto-eggs to merge and lead to a viable egg.</li>
        <li>Since this merging process involves cutting multiple genomes in pieces of varying sizes and then stitching it all back together (it wouldn’t be <i>completely</i> random but rather done like “cut this/these gene(s) from these two genomes and then swap them around,” except done a thousand times with more than just two genomes), this leads to vastly increased odds for point mutations; mutations are also commonly caused by the sun’s radiation, as Timber Hearth’s atmosphere is much thinner than that of our real world Earth (&larr; except in the case of Hal’s universe).</li>
        <li>Mutations are both a powerful tool to create genetic diversity and lead to a fast evolution of the species… <i>and</i> a very effective way to kill off millions of unborn proto-eggs at the earliest stages. <smol>(Don’t cry too hard, think rather of the dozens to hundreds of millions of spermatozoids who could have been you but were denied entry after only one made it)</smol></li>
        <li>As such, while hundreds of millions of proto-eggs are released each year in the same body of water, only a tiny fraction will ever make it to the stage of creating actual eggs with viable and truly novel genomes, which can start cellular mitosis and eventually grow big enough to become visible to the naked eye.</li></ul>
        <p>This results in an alien and rather awkward mixture between “Nobody knows who is related to who” and “But biology prevents inbreeding all by itself so it’s fine” sprinkled in with “Mutations happen so often anyway that it is a significant factor to the genetic diversity all on its own.” At least from what I was told (I asked a friend who asked geneticians and apparently the geneticians said that it <i>wouldn’t</i> instantly devolve into an inbreeding disaster), this could <i>theoretically</i> work on paper for a fictional genderless alien species.</p>
        <hr><p>Viable eggs look pretty much like real world frog eggs; their transparent, gelatinous shells can expand as the embryo grows and develops. Due to Hearthians’ humanoid anatomy and predator-less environment as they evolved into a civilized society, they evolved to no longer have a tadpole stage (as the connection between the skull and the spine would make them terrible swimmers if they lacked limbs to steady themselves). Therefore, hatchlings are fully formed humanoids upon hatching, and their mental capabilities are from the get-go slightly more advanced than those of a human newborn (the soft shell means that their brains have enough space to be able to develop fully before birth, unlike human babies).</p>
        <p>Once born, hatchlings still have a very thin skin which is sensitive to both humidity and general touch (pretty much like real world frogs, with the common “Don’t touch them, they breathe through their skin” saying). For the first few weeks, newly born hatchlings are cared for with constant warm baths (recreating the conditions from underground geothermal ponds) until their skins progressively thicken and adapt to being exposed to air with a scarce atmosphere, instead of water. Hearthians don’t grow scales, but they do have thicker skin than humans — to the extent that a Hearthian forgetting their spacesuit will die of oxygen deprivation faster than they will because of their body’s exposure to the void.</p>
        <p>The latter point does not apply to Hearthians from Hal’s universe: since the atmosphere is much denser and more humid in general, adult Hearthians do not grow to have thicker skin, and are barely more resistant to changes in humidity, temperature or air pressure than real world frogs.</p>
        <hr><p>All that being said, though… With the current population at the time of present FKNO being 22 individuals, the genetic diversity has become too scarce for any egg to make it to the macroscopic scale, let alone to the point of hatching. Some are still hoping for a miracle, but more and more Hearthians are slowly coming to the realization that, even without yet another catastrophy such as a supernova or a Dark Bramble seed, their species is already doomed.</p>
        <p>…They have yet to tell the hatchlings, though. Most of them don’t even know how much bigger the Hearthian population used to be even just a few decades ago.</p>

<!--@SFOLD✔️TH underground waters filled with GM-->
<it wip id=OGTHunderwaterGM class='fkno ahau'><details><summary>Timber Hearth’s underground waters are filled with ghost matter.</summary>
<p>Ever since the Interloper’s core ruptured, Timber Hearth has maintained large amounts of ghost matter within its underwater currents: the water’s nullifying effect on ghost matter and the fact that said water is also for the most part sealed off slows down to a significant degree the rate at which ghost matter evaporates, and the only way for it to successfully leave the water is for it to reach the surface first, notably (but not exclusively) through geysers.</p>
<p style=opacity:.8>In comparison, though Giant’s Deep is filled with water as well, its ocean’s exposure to open air and even to outer space through its cyclones has on the contrary heavily accelerated the rate at which its ghost matter evaporated, leaving only a few small patches clinging to a few islands.</p>
<hr><p>The fact that ghost matter is present in the water depths of Timber Hearth is known, but Hearthians are unable to detect ghost matter while it is in its underwater nullified state. As such, despite being aware of the danger, they are powerless to stop it or efficiently prepare themselves for it, and they are unable to tell just how much ghost matter truly is hiding dormant at the core of their planet. Ironically, staying close to bodies of water remains the safest way to deal with a ghost matter crisis.</p>

<!--@SFOLD✔️GM incident from ~30 years ago-->
<it wip id=30yroGMincident class=fkno><details><summary>About 30 years ago, a new geyser erupting in a corner of the village let out large amounts of ghost matter, decimating a significant part of the village’s remaining population.</summary>
<p>This event is based on Arkose’s reports about the patch of ghost matter they play around, which used to be bigger when Gossan was a hatchling.</p>
<p>The proximity of this patch of ghost matter to the village is due to the fact that it appeared more recently than the village itself, along with the small geyser erupting nearby.</p>
<hr><p>The geyser causing the newest patch of ghost matter to appear erupted very close to what was at the time the hatchlings’ cabin, among many others. After the incident, the hatchlings were relocated to live close to the waterfall (it is the cabin whose porch Tephra and Galena are seen sitting on in-game), with the caretakers’ cabin being the one next to it and closest to the water.</p>
<p>The former cabins were already close to the river at the top of the crater, but not close enough to prevent almost all hatchlings from dying within minutes. Hornfels, Slate, Feldspar, Gossan and Esker (who were about 12 to 18 at the time) were away on a camping trip; otherwise, the only hatchlings who survived were Porphy, Chert and Gabbro.</p>
<hr><p>This kind of event already happened multiple times in the past, each time killing off significant parts of both the wildlife and the Hearthian population, as well as rendering various areas uninhabitable for a few decades. This also contributed to forcing Hearthians to remain hunter-gatherers for the longest time, and to adopt a way of life which makes it relatively easy to relocate through disassembling and reassembling cabins.</p>
<p>With the years, as became usual for Hearthians, building materials and objects located within the patch of ghost matter were carefully retrieved: the bodies were buried, while objects of use were left in specific places away from the village and in open air so that the lingering ghost matter would evaporate faster and eventually make those objects usable once more.</p>
<hr><p>Though each ghost matter incident took a huge toll on the Hearthian civilization’s progress and on the Hearthian population in general, the latest ones, and this one in particular, clearly pushed the Hearthian race closer and closer to extinction because of the dwindling genetic diversity. On the day when the sun goes supernova, the Hearthian population only counts 22 individuals in total, and it has been almost a decade since they last were able to find even a single egg.</p>

<it wip id=OGHeaThinkFeldsDiedOnQM class=fkno><details><summary>Hearthians assume that Feldspar disappeared because they successfully landed on the Quantum Moon, and either died or vanished entirely when it changed locations.</summary>
<p>Feldspar did not contact Timber Hearth before leaving for Dark Bramble. When they never came back, the searches were thus concentrated around Giant’s Deep instead, and made difficult due to the cyclones and drifting islands constantly changing the planet’s layout.</p><hr>
<p>Outer Wilds Ventures knew that Feldspar tried many times to land on the Quantum Moon, without ever succeeding. Due to Hearthians’ lack of knowledge about the Quantum Moon and macroscopic quantum mechanics in general, and with the searches on Giant’s Deep being fruitless, some started to hypothesize that Feldspar found once again the Quantum Moon on their way back, tried one more time to land on it, and actually succeeded for once; only for the Quantum Moon to disappear as it always does.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they assume Feldspar to have died on the spot due to the ‘teleportation’ effect being possibly lethal, to have died while stranded in space because the moon’s disappearance left them behind and too far away to make it to their ship before running out of fuel or oxygen, or to have somehow disappeared entirely and never reappeared along with the moon in its new location, Outer Wilds Ventures slowly put more and more credence in this theory and started mourning without searching any further.</p>
<hr><p>No Hearthian ever tried to land on the Quantum Moon after this, as most assume that its tendency to appear and disappear randomly would be a death sentence in one way or another to any who would be standing on it.</p>

<p>Gossan’s spot pattern used to be circles, just as shown in the museum’s photograph of the founders. However, this changed after they lost their eye.</p>
<p>As a result from the injury, their face sufferred from an infection just two days later; and though they recovered from it, their body’s enhanced immune response locally overexpressed their freckles gene as a defense mechanism. This overexpression led to their spot pattern changing from circles to stripes on their face and ears. Gossan considers this as one more scar to have appeared on their face as a consequence from the incident.</p>
<p>The rest of their body still follows their old circled pattern instead of stripes; but since they rarely ever wear clothes or uniform that show other parts of their body, other Hearthians have grown so accustomed to seeing their stripes that some start to forget that they used to not be there, and most hatchlings were not old enough to have any memory of the times before their incident.</p>

Area 22 lobbying? They stopped people from going in space so as to avoid having unauthorized people find out about the TH signal blocker, or worse, getting the owlks’ attention.

<it wip id=OGHeaSpork class=fkno><details><summary>Vanilla Hearthians do not have forks or spoons (only multi-purpose sporks), and do not eat while sitting at a table.</summary>
Tables are made for working, not for eating. Eating is done while sitting in a circle around a campfire.
Vanilla Hearthians are unfamiliar with forks and spoons, and with the idea of sitting at a table to eat. This is because sporks are the common ancestor to both utensils, and because obviously tables are made for work-related business, not food business. Food business is *village-wide* community business, why use a table to exclude some Hearthians from it? And why would you bother with two utensils instead of one capable of both uses when you have one hand to hold the spork, and one hand to hold your plate/bowl?
In-game, sporks are everywhere. All tables you can find (to my recollection) have something to do with science or some kind of building/fixing-related work, but are not where you would sit at to have a meal. So that kinda just spiralled to "Hal is confused by the sight of a fork and spoon being separated items, and MAU Firn once again is torn between seeing the previous universe’s Hearthians as advanced geniuses (they went to *space*, dammit!) or as uncivilized peasants"

<!--@SFOLD❌History of Nomai warping technology-->
<it wip id=NomaiWarpHistory class=fkno><details><summary>History of Nomai warping technology</summary>
WHS was built first, then the shuttles with more advanced tech that no longer required astral body alignments, and *then* the Ash Twin towers were built but the Nomai thought they'd use the WHS tech instead of the shuttles tech? And Slate based their tech on the Nomai shuttles instead of the warp pads.
1. The Vessel uses an advanced warp core as initially built by Annona, allowing warp travel with no limitations and across large distances.
2. That technology was lost with the crash, leaving the Nomai stranded with the advanced warp core unusable and (presumably) impossible to repair or use to create a duplicate, or even to use as a model for other non-advanced warp cores. Annona eventually died before they could recreate anything, due to a lack of resources. *[Note: Please let me know if there is a canon knowledge of whether Annona died before or after the first functional non-advanced warp core was created]*
3. Brittle Hollow gave access to a black hole, they created the black hole forge, this made them able to recreate warp technology from the ground up. Due to the lack of Annona / the tools the Nomai would usually use for this, recreating non-advanced warp cores already took a while, and those started rudimentary.
4. The first warp cores were used in the White Hole station. Due to this technology's limitations, warps can only occur when an alignment between the black hole core and a massive astral body close to the white hole core happens; they did however manage to make it so that after a black hole &rarr; white hole warp occurs, the white hole core is charged and allows a return trip without alignment limitations thanks to the energy gained by the previous warp.
5. The shuttles were built, and with those a second generation of warp cores which managed to get past the alignment restriction were developed. These warp cores are also used in the HEL (...? Guess we don't know what second-generation warp cores look like but the fact that the HEL's warp cores look identical to the first-generation ones bugs me a little bit because of the next point:).
6. When the Ash Twin Project came and the idea for the towers arose, the Nomai decided to base the towers' warps from the *White Hole Station* warp pads instead of the second generation ones. Probably because or resource limitations, perhaps because of "that way we don't have to adjust the entire warp pad system for a different kind of warp cores" (assuming that even if first and second generation warp cores look the same at first glance, they may have something like different energy requirements or wiring needs/safety precautions and such) coupled with "it's not like warp windows don't occur often enough to make it *that* big of an inconvenience" laziness.
7. The *advanced* warp core was finally remade and used only for the Ash Twin Project, most likely because of a lack of resources + lack of need. (save for the plan to rebuild(?)/return(?) to the Vessel, but that plan was for after the ATP anyway and there's evidently the option to use the same advanced warp core for the vessel later anyway)

The Strangers’ culture has the belief (not necessarily religious, just as a moral standpoint) that Suicide Is A Cardinal Sin. and like that would sort of justify pretty much everything from their reaction to the Eye (going there = killing yourself and the entire universe, at least that is how they interpret it), the Prisoner's choice to release the signal is basically an indirect choice to *choose death*/choose to make others choose (or accidentally commit) self-inflicted death (and therefore their punishment of the utmost cruelty could be justified as "this is *really* what you deserve you Sinner:tm:"), and that could be another reason why not a single one of them ever snuffed out their artifact after an eternity in there. idk their reaction to both the burning church (+ burning everything) and Pris' punishment really felt like *"HeReSy"*. Would put additional weight to Pris' decision, yeah. And that additional weight helps "justify" their particularly harsh punishment… Even if there *could* have been a few of them getting sick of living eternally (not just because of living in the simulation instead of their true home, but also because *eternity is a long time*), they would have been very afraid to so much as speak about it

<it wip id=UnobservedQuantumLogic class=misc><details><summary>While unobserved, macroscopic quantum objects do not interact with light (they cast no shadow) and are partially intangible to any non-quantum object or observer who isn’t entangled with it.</summary>
<p>Concepts used in this headcanon: wave-particle duality (inspired from real world physics but not applied in a way that is accurate to real world physics), quantum entanglement (OW physics).</p><hr>
<p>Unobserved quantum objects are in a <b>wave state</b> rather than particle state, justifying why they cast no shadow and appear invisible in footage or photographs. They can be clipped through while in this state, and though it is not recommended to do so, passing your hand through its matter will let a conscious observer realize that it is warm and flickery to the touch. The intensity of this perception, alongside the resistance you feel upon trying to phase through it, is directly correlated with the number of possible states the quantum object can be in. In the case of the uncollapsed Quantum Moon, which has a near infinite number of possible states (it can not only appear around six celestial bodies, but also anywhere and in any orientation around each of them), its uncollapsed states are so numerous that phasing through it (which you might do if you are launching in space and close your eyes at the correct altitude) is unnoticeable and/or has been mistaken for simply leaving or re-entering the planet’s outer atmosphere.</p>
<p>What matters is “conscious observation”; but “observation” is by itself a subjective term. Quantum objects react to sight when surrounded by species which favor sight as their primary means to perceive the world; however, they would react to other senses while around alien species who do not rely on sight as much (or Hearthians/Nomai who happen to be blind).</p>
<p>If a conscious observer’s favored sense for assessing their surroundings happens to be touch, then they cannot experience phasing through an uncollapsed quantum object, since their sense of touch will always trigger at least a partial collapse related to the area they are able to touch (either by fully collapsing the object into being in their reach, or by partially collapsing its states by making them sense that the quantum object is absent in the specified state they can observe through their sense of touch).</p>

<!-- Wait, but if unobserved quantum objects are invisible, how do yarnflies (for example) and proto-Hearthians see them? Do they instead sense the energy in a way that conscious observers can’t? What happens when GD islands clip into the QM? Make graphs. -->

<!-- <p>That being said, concept of *continuous observation*: the quantum object remains collapsed in its current state even if your primary sense stops observing it, but a secondary sense is still observing it. For a concrete example: if you are holding a quantum rock and looking at it simultaneously, closing your eyes without letting go of the rock will not lead to the quantum object becoming partially intangible (and thus also keeps it in place).
This is what allows entanglement in the first place: you stay standing on the rock, instead of phasing through it because of gravity pulling you down!
...Unless entanglement making you quantum too is the real reason why you don't phase through it. You're just as quantum as it during that time and can't end up in a different state until you open your eyes.</p>-->

<it wip id=OGFirnProveGabbroQuantum class=fkno><details><summary>Firn came up with an experiment which proved Gabbro’s theory about quantum objects.</summary>
<p>I’d like to write a small one-shot or comic about it at some point, so I won’t give too many details… But this ties in with exactly <i>how</i> Gabbro came to conclude that a quantum object “exists in all possible states until it is observed” in the first place. To give a hint: Gabbro often hangs out in the Quantum Grove. Sometimes, right after a rainy day.</p>

<!--
Firn proved that the museum shard is indeed standing in all three locations simultaneously while nobody is watching.

Proving Quantum Objects are in multiple states simultaneously (OLD, MUST REVISE THE LORE): Flashback story to some time after Gabbro’s launch
Hal helps Hornfels put each of the three states of the museum shard on each pillar, then is upset when reading the sign corresponding to it. Later, when they meet up with Firn, they reluctantly admit that Gabbro is right, and that they can prove it by going to the quantum grove.
They go there, and even though it takes some luck and a few attempts, the geyser eventually erupts (which requires for it to be in the correct location), some of the water lands on top of the closest state of the quantum shard. They wait a little bit for it to build up, without ever looking at any of the three spots of the shard. Then, finally, when Firn asks impatiently whether they’ve waited enough, Hal complies and tells them to look in the spot that is closest to the geyser: the shard is there the first time. Hal asks them to close their eyes again, for a little while: when they open them again, the shard is gone, and the water is suspended in midair, then falls to the ground. Firn says that the rock may teleport just right after they open their eyes, that this would lead to the same result. Hal is dejected, saying that they once saw it happen to all three states simultaneously on one time when Gabbro and them had just arrived in the quantum grove on a day when it had rained a little earlier. This gives Firn an idea.
They also discuss a bit about Gabbro, and Firn asks how much Hal misses them. Hal feels bad because they can’t really think of much about them — and how whenever they were in the Quantum Grove, they would hardly ever talk, and just lie down side by side in silence and doze off most of the time.
They go back to the museum shard, and Firn prepares the setup. Hornfels is against it at first, certain that Firn is preparing yet another prank, but Firn says that they can do it with supervision and that Hornfels might as well help with the setup.
“But what does rain have to do with anything?”
“They didn’t want to tell me, they always said they’d rather I either figure it out myself, or wait until we get lucky again. But Hornfels never lets me go to the grove right after rain, the terrain’s too slippery.”

- Stein doesn’t talk about their past much at all. As soon as they were old enough to get out of full time education, they worked in a variety of physical jobs (maybe construction, ranch work, etc) to tide them over for a couple of years, and to save money to get out of town.
- They left (unsure if there is an event that prompts this) after getting their hands on their Triumph Bonneville. It was very beat up and needed a lot of attention at this point, but to them it was a ticket out of there, and a way to head to Newt Yolk to “start over.”
- Depending on how far away their hometown is from NY, they barhopped, did a couple of shifts for a place to stay and food to eat before heading to the next town, until they reached Newt Yolk where they settled at On The Rocks.
- MAU Stein is a little more quiet and reserved than Vanilla TH Stein at this age, mainly because they haven't had the chance to develop connections with others in the same way they would have done on TH

SC "superpower" rules? Do you keep that idea or is Hal (+ Slate’s and Mica’s engineering?) the only one *noticeably* affected?

SC Gabbro saw at some point every hearthian’s quantum fluctuations and was automatically able to read them, deciphering from them the exact rules everyone is under (at least Scoria)? This put them in a state of apathy, as one of their own rules prevents them from not being perpetually chill and calm; but they decided to not tell others about what they saw – aside from Scoria when they figured it out and confronted them about it.

[Scoria] I only like bandanas because the universe *tells me to*!
Gabbro told me all about the rules we’re under. They looked at [Privet]’s records of all our quantum fluctuations, or however they’re called–
It’s not just about giving us weird abilities. They’ve got our *entire schedule* written down!
[Hal] B-but why… Why didn’t you tell Firn about this? They could fix it, make you free again–
[Scoria] What for?
[Hal] (...) Excuse me?
[Scoria] We were never free to begin with. With that many rules dictating *everything*, who even are we? Would everyone even *want* to find out what’d happen if their rules were removed? I don’t even know if *I’d* want to!
[Hal] I… Sorry, but why *wouldn’t* you? I don’t get it…
[Scoria] You wouldn’t understand. Our *entire lives* have been a *lie*.

I’m only ‘Hal’ because *someone* wanted me to be. But I don’t *know* who I really am! I don’t know who Hornfels is! Or Gabbro, or Marl, or *anyone*!
What if they removed everyone’s rules, and… everyone became a complete stranger? What if those rules exist because we’d be *completely different people* without them? *All of us?*

[Scoria] (Scoria starts crying.) Of course I want everyone to be free. But I… Everyone would be so *upset* to find out, a-and if they all asked to have their rules removed, I could lose… I *hate* saying it, but e-even if they’re not the *real* them, I just… I c-can’t lose everyone to strangers.

Musa is based off the Steins;Gate Easter egg that came out with the latest patch! but they are the kind to be against the Ash Twin Project not because "blowing up the sun is bad" like a reasoned Idaea would argue, but rather because *obviously* the entire team working on the project has ulterior motives and plans on using the Eye of the universe in order to develop mind control technology and suppress free will /j
Not a lot of Nomai take them seriously.
Inspiration: Okabe Rintarou except villain because contrary to Steins;Gate they’re factually in the wrong

<h2>Hearthian Time &rarr; Human Time</h2>
<p align=left>Hearthian time is conventionally written as <code class='spanintro smol'>--d--s --:--</code> where the four empty slots indicate from left to right the day number in the week, the sunrise number in the day, the number of minutes, and finally the number of seconds. If you click on <span class=spanintro style=filter:hue-rotate(70deg)>Hearthian time &rarr; In-game time</span>, then all four values are required.</p>
<p align=left>The time loop occurs between <code class='spanintro smol'>06d03s 45:09</code> (in-game equivalent being 00:00) and <code class='spanintro smol'>06d07s 01:18</code> (in-game equivalent being 22:40). No error will be raised if you input a timestamp that does not fall between those boundaries, but the output result may be incorrect (specifically if you provide a timestamp earlier than the start of the loop).</p>
<p align=left>If you click on <span class=spanintro style=filter:hue-rotate(70deg)>Human Circadian Rhythm Equivalent</span>, then the day number may be omitted (submitting <code class='spanintro smol'>--s --:--</code> or <code class='spanintro smol'>--:--:--</code> or even <code class='spanintro smol'>-- -- --</code> is just as valid as submitting <code class='spanintro smol'>--d--s --:--</code>).</p>
<h2>Human Time &rarr; Hearthian Time</h2>
<p align=left style=padding-bottom:20px>The recommended input format is either <code class='spanintro smol'>--:--:--</code> (hours, minutes, seconds) or <code class='spanintro smol'>--:--</code>. In the latter case, the two numbers will be interpreted either as minutes and seconds (if you click on <span class=spanintro style=filter:hue-rotate(70deg)>In-game time &rarr; Hearthian time</span>, which expects a number within or soon after the confines of the time loop) or as hours and minutes (if you click on <span class=spanintro style=filter:hue-rotate(70deg)>Hearthian Circadian Rhythm Equivalent</span>). Human times used here expect a <b>24-hour clock format</b> rather than a 12-hour format.</p>
